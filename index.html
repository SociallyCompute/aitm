<p>I need reviewers and content contributors. I especially appreciate well-informed sidebars on specific topics and will give full in-text authorial credit for such. Or, you can help with the body of the text. I also want to cultivate an ecosystem of labs, but that is a different story.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My desire is that interested parties contribute to this project via standard Github techniques. I realize this places a barrier for some otherwise qualified contributors. However, I believe that <strong>source control is a singularly important practice</strong>; it is the constraint which enables much of the benefits of Agile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learning Github is a good use of your time, if you seek to teach the next generation of IT practitioners. They are heading out into a world of "infrastruture as code" and pervasive use of source control. Github portfolios are increasingly selection criteria in the hiring process for IT professionals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Of course, if you have a nice standalone sidebar, or a <strong>few</strong> random edits, send them on to me however and I can work them in.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of an Agile medium, the format of the book on Github will allow for better "random access" reviewing. This I think will be an improvement over the standard "read a big batch of my work please." I&#8217;ll point to specific sections as they are completed, and as discussions progress on Twitter &amp; other channels, an approach I think is more agile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will say more about the labs elsewhere, but I have found that developing good labs is extraordinarily labor-intensive. I intend that each chapter have a solid lab (or multiple alternatives) and would greatly value any contributions that align with the book&#8217;s progression.</p>

<p>I have not decided on a publishing channel. I am experimenting with LeanPub, but the final decision is pending. The work would always be free here, but I may put additional formatting work in and sell the resulting value-added product. I am  considering setting up a nonprofit of some sort to further the work. And I am still considering the licensing options. Interested in any ideas along these lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My stance on these issues depends directly on other people making substantial contributions. If that does not happen, I will consider other, more proprietary models, although I remain concerned for educational access and am not inclined to publish this solely as a $150.00 glossy textbook.</p>

<h3 id="_the_it_industry_and_the_rise_of_agile">The IT industry, and the rise of Agile</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A primary goal of this book, as a textbook, is to prepare the student for an information technology career in industry, “industry” being broadly defined as both those industries that offer IT products, as well as industries that rely on IT instrumentally for delivering all kinds of products. A central theme of the book is that “IT,” considered as a component, represents an increasing proportion of ALL industrial products (both consumer and business facing). This is known as "digital transformation."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of this, the IT industry, and my understanding of it, have transformed dramatically in the past ten years, and the transformation has accelerated even more in the last five. However, IT remains under-managed and poorly understood relative to peer functions in the enterprise. The DevOps and Agile movements promise transformation, but are encountering an entrenched legacy of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>enterprise architecture,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>program and project management,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>business process management,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT service management practices, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT governance concerns</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The challenges of this legacy are an ongoing theme throughout this introductory text. However, some of the more radical voices in the Agile movement seem to think that the legacy can be simply swept away. The following cautionary message from Mike Burrows shows that, in terms of core Agile philosophy, this would be ill-advised:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>“…some will tell you that when things are this bad, you throw it all away and start again. It&#8217;s ironic: The same people who would champion incremental and evolutionary approaches to product development seem only too eager to recommend disruptive and revolutionary changes in people-based systems – in which the outcomes are so much less certain.”</em> <a href="#Burrows2014">[Burrows2014]</a>, Kindle Locations 827-829.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT management at scale within an organization is a complex system. Complex systems do not respond well to dramatic perturbations. They are best changed incrementally, with careful monitoring of the consequences of each small change. (This is part of the systems theory foundation underlying the Agile movement.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, how do we undertake Agile transformation? For longer term, more ambitious goals, while we cannot plan in advance how any given change initiative will play out, we <strong>can</strong> develop awareness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea of the OODA loop is popular in the Agile community. OODA stands for Orient, Observe, Decide, Act, a set of concepts developed by Air Force colonel John Boyd in analyzing the performance of aviators in the Korean War. The faster an actor can move through this cycle, the more effective they will be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I propose this book as an initial “OO” of the “OODA” loop for those seeking Agile transformation of their IT capabilities. Its purpose is to provide the student with a well documented set of observations on IT&#8217;s current challenges that can orient you for more effective decisions and actions in your journey toward IT excellence.</p>

<h3 id="_some_personal_history">Some personal history</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I teach a survey course, at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, at the graduate level in the department of Software Engineering and Information Systems. This program at St. Thomas is the largest such program in the country and is comprised of a broad mix of students. Some are fresh out of a non-technical four-year liberal arts degree, and some have years of IT experience in businesses of various sizes, including the region&#8217;s many Fortune 500 corporations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can imagine, this breadth of experience poses some challenges, but also presents opportunities if one can figure out good ways for the students to teach each other&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;to be covered in the associated lab materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My class is titled "IT Infrastructure" for historical reasons (derived from the "IT Infrastructure Library," or ITIL), and was intended from its creation to cover the management of IT broadly. It is not limited to a narrower definition of "IT infrastructure" that would focus only on servers, operating systems, storage, networking, data centers, and the like. Rather, it serves as a contextual course for the students in their in-depth studies of programming, databases, security, networking, and so forth.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most authors of IT/MIS survey texts struggle in my opinion with structuring their narrative. Many start by discussing (in too much depth) various computing fundamentals and then switch to a laundry list of assorted topics, including business needs for computing, project management, programming, database and network management, IT processes, security, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A smaller number of authors may start with the business motivation and then go into the functional areas, but in either case these narratives are rather fragmented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Waterfall assumptions are found throughout many of these texts, not just as explicit discussion, but embedded pervasively as a mental model, that IT is "planned, built, and run."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While Agile techniques are certainly mentioned, they are typically grafted onto the former narrative.  Mostly, Agile is discussed in the context of project management. Questions of end to end flow, product management, Agile infrastructure, culture and organization, the relationship to Lean, and many other such topics go unaddressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned above, educators have a responsibility to effectively respond to the new realities of Lean product development and the end to end Agile transformation looming for enterprises. This can no longer be dismissed as "flavor of the month" or a fad. It is a fundamental transformation of business and society, ultimately based in Mark Andreessen&#8217;s observation that "software is eating the world."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, there is almost no recognition that the management of information technology differs greatly depending on the <strong>size and maturity of the organization</strong>. College textbooks tend to assume that students are interacting with computers in the context of large, bureaucratic organizations. A smaller percentage may talk about computers and software as products to be developed and marketed in their own right.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Few if any discuss the challenging questions of scaling IT management, and the state transitions it implies. I believe <strong>in embracing the scaling problem we can develop an effective pedagogy that can orient even the greenest student</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The structure of the book is documented in the next section, Introduction.</p>

<h4 id="_assumptions_of_the_reader">Assumptions of the reader</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This book is written at the graduate student level. It is currently available only in English.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no assumption of deep IT experience, but there is an assumption that the person interacts with computers in some depth. They should for example understand the concept of an "operating system." An A+ certification, for example, would more than adequately prepare someone for this book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person completely unfamiliar with computing will need to supplement their reading as suggested throughout the text. There is a wealth of free and accurate information on IT fundamentals (e.g. compute, storage, networking, programming, etc) and this book seeks more to curate than replicate.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In keeping with the entrepreneurial spirit that gave rise to the Agile movement and works like Ries' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307887898/"><em>The Lean Startup</em>,</a> I am structuring this book around a progressive, evolutionary approach. Your journey through it reflects a process of emergence. Such processes are most often associated with founding and scaling a startup. There are many helpful books on this topic, such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nail-then-Scale-Entrepreneurs-Breakthrough/dp/0983723605"><em>Nail it then scale it</em></a> by Furr and Ahlstrom</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, this is not a textbook (or course) on a full startup process. It remains IT-centric. <strong>And, the book is also intended to be relevant to students entering directly into large, established enterprises.</strong> In fact, it prepares students for working in all stages of growth because it progresses through these four contexts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Individual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enterprise</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether students are in a startup, or on a journey within a larger, established organization, they will (hopefully) become aware as they progress through a broadening context:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Other team members</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppliers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sponsors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Necessary non-IT capabilities (finance, legal, HR, sales, marketing, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channel partners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auditors and regulators</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Part of maturing in one&#8217;s career is understanding how all these relationships figure into your own overall system of value delivery. This will be a lifelong journey for you; my intent is to give you some useful tools.</p>

<p>As a structuring mechanism, I have tested this in the classroom with some success. I divide a 14-week semester into four major sections, with each having a distinct "persona" for the students to adopt:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist upperalpha">
<ol class="upperalpha" type="A">
<li>
<p><strong>Inception</strong>: The students are teamed as pairs of practitioners , each in a hypothetical startup, in a garage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: The students are in teams of 6-9, enough for specialization to emerge, but still intensely collaborative. A startup that has started to become viable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coordination</strong>: The entire class becomes one large organization, a "team of teams" faced with the hard problems of coordination and communication across space and time barriers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maturation</strong>: Students are in groups of 4-5, representing the executive leadership of a large enterprise, concerned with IT portfolios, analytics, and the complex dynamics of running heterogeneous IT at massive scale.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p><em>Analytics and Complexity</em> We need to measure this massive IT estate and understand it as an overall dynamic system.

<p>The central advantage of this approach is that it is ideal for the new student. There are no technical prerequisites for a course based on this text, although it can be a lot of work for those completely new to IT. Discussions of advanced IT issues such as process frameworks are presented as part of a logical evolutionary progression and thought experiment, rather than simply dropped on the unsuspecting student.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_labs">Labs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With three chapters in each section, the book can be covered in one intense semester at a chapter a week, although expanding it to a two-semester treatment would allow for more in-depth coverage and increased lab exposure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I give great credit to both my students and Dr. Misra for challenging me to add a practical component to the course. This required new thinking on my part. How to demonstrate IT management at scale in a lab setting? I have learned that a hands on component is critical, as IT management discussions can be  abstract and meaningless to many students. (”Incidents are different from Problems!”)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ten years ago, the best that would have been possible would be paper case studies, perhaps augmented with spreadsheets. But new options are now available. The power of modern computers (even lightweight laptops) coupled with the widespread availability of open source software, makes it is now possible to expose students to industrial computing in a meaningful, experiential way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have found great utility in the use of lightweight virtualization technologies such as Vagrant, Virtualbox and Docker.  I recommend this approach wholeheartedly. I am always interested in hearing from other instructors who are working from the same approach.</p>

<p>At this writing I maintain my labs publicly on Github.  My syllabus and lab structure is under continual improvement. This is my current aspirational plan.</p>

<p>I use a central server in teaching my classes, but even that is not necessary. This class can be taught with a zero computing budget, assuming that each team of students at least has access to a modern laptop and a fast Internet connection. As of this writing, I am using free and open source versions of Chef, Jenkins, iTOP, jUnit, Ant, and other tools (see github for the current approach).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some may question the inclusion of command-line experience, but without some common technical platform it is hard to provide a meaningful “hands-on” experience in the first half of the course. I structure my class on the assumption that the students are at least willing to learn computing techniques, with no prerequisites beyond that. Not even a programming language is required; the Java currently used as a sample is minimal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Truly beginning students will have to work at the Linux tutorials, but all they need master is basic command line navigation, and I have found this possible with a diverse student body. The labs for the second half of the course use experiential paper-based classroom exercises, GUI-based software, databases, and office productivity tools.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the introduction to Section I.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we  explore the fundamentals of information technology delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are working in a startup, alone or with one partner. You are always in the same room, easily able to carry on a running conversation about your efforts and progress. You have no time or resources to spend on anything except keeping your new system alive and running.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 1: IT Value</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Chapter 1 introduces you to the fundamental concepts of IT value that serve as a basis for the rest of the course. Why do people want computing (IT) services? What are the general outlines of their structure? How do they come into being? How are they changed over time?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of this is essential to understand for your scenario; you need to understand what computers can do and how they are generally used, if you are going to create a product based on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter also covers the basics of how you&#8217;ll approach building a product. It&#8217;s assumed you won&#8217;t develop an intricate, long-range plan but rather will be experimenting with various ideas and looking for "fast feedback" on their success or failure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 2: IT Infrastructure</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, you have a general idea for a product and are ready to start building it. But not so fast&#8230;&#8203; you need to decide some fundamentals first. How will your new product run? What will you use to build it?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not possible to begin construction until you decide on your tools. This chapter will provide you an overview of computing infrastructure including Cloud hosting and various approaches to system configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter also presents an overview of source control, as even your infrastructure depends on it in the new world of "infrastructure as code."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 3: Application delivery</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you&#8217;re ready to start building something. While this is not a book on software development or programming languages, it&#8217;s important to understand some basics and at least see them in action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is also the "DevOps" chapter; it&#8217;s not just about writing code, but about the entire end to end system that gets the code you are writing from your workstation, into collaborative environments, and finally to a state where it can be accessed by end users. From source repository to build manager to package repository to production, we&#8217;ll cover a basic toolchain that will help you understand modern industrial practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>This section&#8217;s lab approach</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this is not a book about any particular computing language or platform, we need to describe some technical fundamentals. We’ll do so in as neutral a manner as possible. However, the specific technologies employed in this books’ accompanying labs are based on Ubuntu Linux and git, the distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds to facilitate Linux development.</p>

<h4 id="_introduction_to_chapter_1">Introduction to Chapter 1</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted at the outset, you are one or two people in a startup. You are building a product of which IT is a significant part (otherwise why are you reading this book/in this class?) Your motivations are entrepreneurial; you want to create a successful business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might be housed within a larger enterprise, but the thought experiment here is that you have substantial autonomy to order your efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You want to do something that has a unique IT component. Regardless of your business, you will need accounting and legal services at a minimum, and very quickly payroll and HR, and so forth. Those things can (and should) be purchased as commodity services, if you are a small entrepreneur (I am not aware of any convincing arguments to the contrary, unless you are absolutely on the smallest of shoestring budgets and can work 100 hour weeks).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your unique value proposition will be expressed to some degree in unique IT software. While this software may be based on well understood products, the configuration and logic you construct will be all your own. Because of this, you are now (whether you intend or not) a producer (or soon to be) of IT services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we can talk about building and managing information technology (IT), we need to understand what it is and why people want it. We&#8217;ll start this chapter by looking at an IT value experience that may seem very familiar. Then we&#8217;ll dig further into concepts like the "IT stack" and the "IT service" and how they change over time.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an introductory text. You may see terms below that are unfamiliar (Model-View-Controller, IP, packet switching). If you are reading this online, you can follow the links, but it&#8217;s not required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you progress in your career, you will always be encountering new terminology. Part of what you need to learn is when it&#8217;s important to dig into it, and when you can let it pass for a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should be able to understand the gist presented below that these are complex systems based on a wide variety of technologies, some of them old, some new.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The screen on her cell phone represents information accessed and presented via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller framework</a>, implemented in the latest version of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Javascript</a>, running on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreter</a> that would have taxed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">mainframe</a> thirty years ago. The communication with her bank’s central systems is supported by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)">4G LTE</a> data which in turn relies on the high-volume <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">IP backbone</a> networks operated by the <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/telecom-carrier">telecommunications carriers</a>, based on research into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching">packet switching</a> now approaching 50 years old.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The application operating on the cell phone interacts with core banking systems via sophisticated and highly secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware">middleware</a>, crossing multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">network</a> control points. This middleware talks in turn to the customer demand deposit system that still runs on the mainframe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mainframe is now running the latest version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/OS">IBM’s zOS</a> operating system (a direct descendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors#MVT">OS/360</a>, one of the most  significant operating systems in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing">history of computing</a>). The "customer demand deposit" banking application running on the mainframe is still based on code written in the lowest level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembler</a>. Some of the comments in this code date back to the 1970s. It has been tuned and optimized over the decades into a system of remarkable speed and efficiency. Although replatforming it is periodically discussed, the cost/benefit ratio for such a project has to date not been favorable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reservation system looks similar on the mobile device, but the network routes it to a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud</a> data center hosting the reservation system. The back end application here is very different from the banking system; the programming languages are newer, the database is structured very differently, and the operating system is <a href="https://www.linux.com/">Linux</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the navigation software looks much like the reservation system, as it too is based on the Cloud. However, the system is much more active, as it is continually processing inputs from millions of drivers in thousands of cities, and updating traffic maps for those drivers in real time so that they can choose the most optimal route to their destinations (e.g., dinner). The capabilities of this system are comparable to an air traffic control system, and yet it is available as a free download for our IT user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The resulting value is clear:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In an earlier era, our user might have stayed in, for fear of bouncing a check, or might have gone out and dined beyond her means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The phone line at the restaurant might have been busy, so she might have risked showing up with no reservation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before texting and social media, she might not have been able to reach her friends as easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without the traffic application she might have run into a huge midtown traffic jam and been half an hour late.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clearly, information technology added value to her life and helped maximize her experiences of social enjoyment.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_what_is_it_anyways">What is IT, anyways?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ve started this book in the previous section, by first defining IT value. This is deliberate. But what is IT, anyways?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The computers? The networks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people who run them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That organization that loves to say “no” and is always slow and expensive?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>None of these are how this book defines “IT.” Although this is not a technical book on computer science or software engineering, the intent is that it reflects and is compatible with academic theory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, “information technology” is defined as the edifice of theory and practice based on the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a>, and the other pioneers who defined the central problems of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">digital logic</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability">computability</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture">computer architecture</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="1.01.02-IT-as-function-2"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Discussions of “information technology” become contentious because some think of the traditional organization, while others think of the general problem area. IT has a long history as a corporate function, a single hierarchy under a powerful Chief Information Officer. This model has had its dysfunctions, including a longstanding reputation for being slow and expensive. Often, when one encounters the term “IT,” the author using the term is referring to this organizational tradition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>We are less interested in the future of IT as a distinct organizational structure. There are many different models, from fully centralized to fully embedded.</strong> Organizational structure will be discussed in Chapter 7.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this book, we define “Information technology” in terms of its historic origins. We look to IT’s common origins in automating the laborious and error prone processes of computation, through the application of digital logic technologies based on information transmission.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of organizational form or delivery methods, IT is defined by these origins. And there are notable common threads throughout this problem domain: the fragility and complexity of these systems, the need for layered abstractions in their management, and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It does not matter if the application developers ultimately report up through the CIO, the CMO, the CFO, or the COO. Their daily experience remains largely the same. The dynamics of their management remain the same. Executives who seek to take control of IT so they can “remove that old bureaucracy” are well advised to be cautious; the bureaucracy emerged for a reason. More on this in subsequent chapters.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT increasingly permeates business operations and social interactions. The breadth and depth of IT support for virtually all domains of society continues to expand. Lately, this is known as digital transformation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As IT increases its pervasiveness, it becomes difficult to detangle and analyze it. However, doing so remains essential because without a line of sight back to its intellectual foundations, any technology risks becoming magic, and its users risk becoming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Sidebar: Cargo cult</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During World War II, South Pacific native peoples had been exposed abruptly to modern technological society with the Japanese and US occupations of their islands. Occupying forces would often provide food, tobacco, and luxuries to the natives to ease relations. After the war, various tribes were observed creating simulated airports and airplanes, and engaging in various rituals that superficially looked like air traffic signaling and other operations associated with a military air base.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On further investigation, it became clear that the natives were seeking more “cargo” and had developed a magical understanding of how goods would be delivered. By imitating the form of what they had seen, they hoped to recreate it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 1974, the noted physicist Richard Feynman gave a speech at Caltech in which he coined the immortal phrase “cargo cult science.” His intent was to caution against activities which appear to follow the external form of science, but lack the essential understanding at its core.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It should be noted, as with most archetypes of this sort, that there are questions around the accuracy of the original accounts and Western interpretations and mythmaking around what was seen. However there is no question that the phenomena were observed. There is also no doubt that “cargo cult thinking” is a useful cautionary metaphor.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nicholas Carr, in his controversial <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article "IT Doesn&#8217;t Matter," recognized that IT was becoming commoditized in an important sense. As Cloud providers started to offer utility-style computing, the choice of vendors like HP vs IBM was no longer strategic. Looking to history, Carr argued that just as businesses no longer have “Vice Presidents for Electricity,” so businesses no longer need Chief Information Officers or dedicated IT departments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Carr has insight&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;there is no question IT is becoming pervasive&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but he ultimately reflects a narrow view of what “IT” is. If “IT” were merely computation at the lowest level&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;just shuffling bits of information around, doing a little math&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;then perhaps it could be embedded throughout a business like electricity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But IT has emergent aspects that are not comparable to electrical power. As it pervades all dimensions of business operations, it brings its concerns with it: complexity, fragility, and the skills required to cope with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One watt of electrical power is like any other watt of electrical power, and can usefully be seen as a commodity. We can use it to run toasters, hair dryers, or industrial paint mixers, and there is little concern (beyond supply and demand management) that the consumption of power by the paint mixer will affect the toaster.  It&#8217;s also true that one cycle of computing, in a certain sense, is like any other cycle. But information technology systems interact with each other in surprising and unpredictable ways that are not comparable to simple electrical power.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT also radically transforms industries: from retail to transportation to manufacturing to genetics. Applied software-centric IT is unleashing remarkable economic disruption.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lawyer may depend on a cell phone, and (in keeping with Carr) beyond its provision as a commodity service, needs little else to deliver the legal strategies a firm needs. A graphic designer may use computerized graphic tools, but these have become relatively standardized and commoditized in the past twenty years, and probably are not a source of competitive advantage in the quest for new marketing clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, consider a text analytic algorithm that replaces thousands of paralegals, resulting in order-of-magnitude more accurate legal research in a fraction of cost and time. This <strong>is</strong> strategic and disruptive to the legal community. A superior supply chain algorithm, and the ability to improve it on an ongoing basis, may indeed elevate a logistics firm’s performance above competitors. In cases like these&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and they seem to be increasing&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;IT matters very much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the digitally transforming economy, traditional “back office” IT organizations find themselves called on to envision, develop, and support market-facing applications of IT. And what starts with one market-facing use case can quickly expand into entire portfolios.  It is such cases that are of particular concern in this book.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether IT is housed under a traditional CIO, an operations capability, a Chief Marketing Officer, or a “line of business”, when it is critical to operations certain concerns inevitably follow:</p>

<p>In the example, our friend seeking a relaxing night out had several moments of truth:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consulting her bank balance, and subsequent financial transactions also reflecting what was stated to her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making a reservation and having it honored on arrival at the restaurant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arriving on time to the restaurant, courtesy of the traffic application</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each of these individual value experiences was co-created by our friend&#8217;s desire for value, and the response of a set of IT resources.</p>

<p>In order to view her balance, our user is probably using an application downloaded from a "store" of applications made available to her device. On her device, this "app" is part of an intricate set of components performing functions such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>connecting to the phone network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>securely connecting over the phone network to the Internet and then to the bank</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying the user to the bank&#8217;s systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>requesting the necessary information (in this case, an account balance)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>receiving that information and converting it to a form that can be represented on a screeen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>finally, displaying the information on the screen</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The application, or "app," downloaded to the phone plays a primary role, but is enabled by:</p>

<p>the phone&#8217;s operating system and associated services</p>

<li>
<p>the telecommunications infrastructure (cell phone towers, long distance fiber optic cables, switching offices, and much more)</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, without the banking systems on the other end, there is no bank balance to transmit. These systems are similar, but on a much larger scale than our friend&#8217;s device:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Internet and middleware services to receive the request from the international network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application services to validate the user&#8217;s identity and route the request to the appropriate handling service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data services to store the user&#8217;s banking information (account identity and transactions) along with millions of other customers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many additional services to detect fraud and security attacks, report on utilization, identify any errors in the systems, and much more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical data centers full of computers and associated hardware including massive power and cooling infrastructure, and protected by security systems and personnel.</p>

<p>Therefore, as we study this world, we need to maintain awareness of her perspective. Our friend is seeking some value that IT uniquely can enable, but does not want to consider all the complexity that goes into it. She just wants to go out with friends. The moment of truth depends on the service; the service may contain great complexity, but part of its success lies in shielding the user from that complexity.</p>

<p>This fundamental tension between <strong>what</strong> a system is supposed to do, versus <strong>how</strong> it does it, pervades IT management and will likely define your career.

<p>In general, in this book, we will use the following definitions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An IT service is defined primarily in terms of WHAT not HOW</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defining an IT system may include a discussion of both WHAT it does and HOW it does it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An "application" usually means some IT service or system for end users who are not primarily concerned with IT other than wanting to get something done with it (e.g. go out to dinner)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Infrastructure" usually means some IT service or system that primarily supports OTHER IT services or systems (e.g. a network "service" is not usually useful to end users without additional application services.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the concept of the "IT stack" is important. Notice how the different technology layers appear "stacked." Layered approaches to understanding IT are common; see Further Reading for useful references.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_it_service_lifecycle">The IT service lifecycle</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve established that the IT service is based on a complex stack of technology, from local devices to global networks to massive data centers. Software and hardware are layered together in endlessly inventive ways to solve problems people did not even know they had ten years ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But these IT service systems must come from somewhere. They must be designed, built, and operated, and (as any smartphone user can testify) they are continually improved over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple representation of the IT service lifecycle is shown in the figure below.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>It starts with an idea. Someone has an insight into an IT-enabled value proposition that can make a profit, or better fulfill a mission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea must garner support and resources so that it can be built.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea is then constructed, at least as an initial proof of concept or Minimum Viable Product (in the language of Ries' <em>Lean Startup</em>.) Construction is assumed to include an element of design; in this textbook, <strong>construction and design are not represented as two separate phases.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a critical state transition however that will always exist. Initially, it is the change from OFF to ON when the system is first constructed. After the system is ON, there are still distinct changes in state when new features are deployed, or incorrect behaviors ("bugs" or "defects") are rectified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system may be ON, but it is not delivering value until the user can access it. Sometimes, that may be as simple as providing someone with a network address, but usually there is some initial "provisioning" of system access to the user, who needs to identify themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system can then deliver services (moments of truth) to the end users. It may deliver millions or billions of such experiences, depending on its scale and how one might choose to count the subjective concept of value experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user may have access, but may still not receive value, if they do not understand the system well enough to use it. Whether via a formal service desk, or informal social media channels, users of IT services will require and seek support on how to maximize the value they are receiving from the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, support requests indicate that something is wrong with the system itself. If the system is no longer delivering value experiences (bank balances, restaurant reservations, traffic directions) then some action must be taken promptly to restore service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of the previous states in the lifecycle generate data and insight that lead to further evolution of the system. There is a wide variety of ways systems may evolve: new user functionality, more stable technology, increased system capacity, and more. Such motivations result in new construction and changes to the existing system, and so the cycle begins again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8230;&#8203;Unless&#8230;&#8203; the system&#8217;s time is at an end. If there is no reason for the system to exist any longer, it should be retired.</p>

<h4 id="_defining_consumer_customer_and_sponsor">Defining consumer, customer, and sponsor</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In understanding IT value, it is essential to clarify the definitions of user, customer, and sponsor. Sometimes, the user <strong>is</strong> the customer. But more often, the user and the customer are different, and one may additionally need to distinguish the role of system or service sponsor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following definitions may help</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>consumer</strong> (sometimes called the <strong>user</strong>) is the person actually interacting with the IT-based service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>customer</strong> is a source of revenue for the service. If the service is part of a profit center, the customer is the person actually purchasing the product (e.g. demand deposit banking.) If the service is part of a cost center (e.g. an HR system), the customer is best seen as an internal executive, as the actual revenue-producing customers are too far removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>sponsor</strong> is the person who authorizes and controls the funding used to construct and operate the service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the service type, these roles can be filled by the same or different people. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>So, who paid for our user&#8217;s enjoyment? The bank and restaurant both had clear motivation for supporting a better online experience, and people now expect that service organizations provide this. The bank experiences less customer turnover and increased likelihood that customers add additional services. The restaurant sees increased traffic and smoother flow from more efficient reservations. Both see increased competitiveness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The traffic application is a somewhat different story. While it is an engineering marvel, there is still some question as to how to fund it long term. It requires a large user base to operate, and yet end consumers of the service are unlikely to pay for it. At this writing, the service draws on advertising dollars from businesses wishing to advertise to passersby, and also sells its real-time data on traffic patterns to a variety of customers, such as developers considering investments along given routes.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>IT exists in a social context</strong></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like the proverbial fish that doesn&#8217;t understand water (because water it all it knows), we may lose sight of the laws and customs that enable us to use computers in the ways covered in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the ability for banks to hold money as electronic bits on a computer is rooted in the earliest history of banking and the emergence of centralized settlement and clearing mechanisms. Cell phone companies rely on international treaties, and national laws and regulations allocating radio spectrum.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The existence of physical voice and data connectivity relies on laws supporting utility easements and rights of way, and even treaties such as the Law of the Sea (how is it that undersea cables remain unmolested?).</p>

<p>As mentioned in the section introduction, you cannot start developing a product until you decide what you will write it with. (You may have a difficult time writing an app for a mobile phone if you choose the COBOL programming language!)  You also need to understand something of how computers are operated, enough so that you can make decisions on how your system will run. Most startups choose to run IT services on infrastructure owned by a Cloud provider, but there are other options. Certainly, as you scale up, you&#8217;ll need to be more and more sophisticated in your understanding of your underlying IT services.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter, you were introduced to the concept of a Moment of Truth, and in the final exercises asked to think of a product idea. Some part of that product requires writing software, or at least configuring some IT-centric system.

<p>You presumably have some resources (time and money). It’s Monday morning, you have cleared all distractions, shut down your Twitter and Facebook feeds, and are ready to start building.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not so fast.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before you can start writing code, you need some kind of a platform. It&#8217;s hard to build before you decide on your tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need to decide what language you are going to write in, or what framework you are going to configure, and how that effort is going to result in an operational system capable of rendering IT services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are probably swimming in a sea of advice and options regarding your technical choices. In previous decades, books such as this might have gone into the specifics of particular platforms: mainframe vs. minicomputers, COBOL vs Fortran, Windows vs Unix, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this writing, JavaScript is a leading choice, in conjunction with various frameworks and NoSQL options (e.g. the MEAN stack, for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js), but millions of developers are still writing Java and .Net, and Ruby and Python have significant followings. Linux is arguably the leading platform, but commercial Unix and Microsoft platforms are still strong. And, periodically it&#8217;s reported that the majority of the world&#8217;s transactions <strong>still</strong> run on <a href="http://blog.hackerrank.com/the-inevitable-return-of-cobol/">COBOL-based systems</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, in the past few years, some powerful infrastructure concepts have solidified that are independent of particular platforms:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automation and “infrastructure as code”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The centrality of source control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance of package management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy-based infrastructure management</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(We&#8217;ll get to test-driven development &amp; DevOps in the next chapter.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This might seem like a detour - you are in a hurry to start writing code! But industry practice is clear. You check your code into source control from Day One. You define your server configurations as recipes, manifests, or at least shell scripts, and check those definitions into source control as well. You keep track of what you have downloaded from the Internet and what version of stuff you are using. Always downloading the “latest” package from its upstream creator might seem like the way to stay current, but it will kill you when stuff works on one server but not on another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, you need to understand a few things and make a few decisions that you will be living with for a while, and will not be easily changed.</p>

<h5 id="_what_is_infrastructure">What is Infrastructure?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Infrastructure is a tricky word. Google defines it thus:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>￼<em>The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g., buildings, roads, and power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, it connotes the stuff behind the scenes, the things you need but don’t want to spend a lot of time thinking about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will spend a lot of time examining what we mean by “infrastructure” in this book, as it is fundamental to understanding the “business of IT.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book defines “IT infrastructure” recursively as “the set of IT concerns that are of particular interest to IT.”</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An application or business service is consumed by people who are NOT primarily concerned with IT. For example, a customer-facing online banking service is consumed by end users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An IT infrastructure service is a service consumed by other IT-centric teams and capabilities. For example, a database or a load balancing service is consumed by other IT teams.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT infrastructure is one form of infrastructure. Other kinds of infrastructure might include mechanical, electrical, and plant investments (ME &amp; P). IT infrastructure, like IT itself, is defined by its fundamental dependence on information and computing theory [link Chapter 1].</p>

Today’s application becomes tomorrow’s infrastructure. Forty years ago, building an “application” would have included building its database, perhaps even its file management. This was rightly determined to be a general-case problem that could be the basis for commodity software, and so companies like Oracle were born.<br>
<br>
Operating systems took on more and more functionality, technology became more and more reliable and easily configured, and once unique (and competitively differentiating) functionality became commoditized and more and more deeply buried in the “stack”: the IT infrastructure.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many books (some in the Further Reading section for this chapter) on all aspects of IT infrastructure, which is a broad and deep topic. Our discussion of it here has to be high level, as appropriate for a survey course.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve established <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_defining_information_technology">what we mean by IT generally</a>. Pragmatically, there are three major physical aspects to "IT infrastructure" relevant to the practitioner:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Computing cycles (sometimes called just "compute")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory &amp; storage (or "storage")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Networking &amp; communications (or "network")</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will discuss a variety of subsidiary concerns and concepts, but those are the big three.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>If we have a picture of our friend, and we use a digital filter to adjust the brightness, that is an application of compute power. The picture is made up of "pixels" which are nothing but numbers representing the color of some tiny square of the picture. Each of those numbers needs to be evaluated and the brightness adjusted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say that the pixel values range from 1 to 10, with 1 being the darkest and 10 being the lightest (in reality, the range is much larger.) We might tell the computer:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Look at a pixel
If it is between 0 and 3 add 2
If it is between 4 and 6 add 1
Move to a new pixel
Repeat the above 4 lines until all pixels are done</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a more realistic level, the process might be executed as a batch on a workstation, for hundreds or thousands of photos at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computers process instructions at the level of "true" and "false," represented as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a> "1s" and "0s." Because humans cannot easily understand binary data and processing, higher-level abstractions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">machine code</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming languages</a> are used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computer processing is not free. Moving data from one point to another - the fundamental transmission of information - requires matter and energy, and is bound up in physical reality. This despite claims like, "information wants to be free." In the real world, even running the simplest calculation has physical and therefore economic cost, and so we must pay for computing.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Storage</strong> But where did the picture come from? The data comprising the pixels needs to be stored somewhere. Sometimes you will hear the technical term "persisted." The combined set of pixels and their precise values can be termed the "state" of the photograph; the digital logic of the filter alters the state, and also needs to save this new state somewhere (otherwise it will be lost).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many technologies <a href="http://www.zetta.net/history-of-computer-storage/">have been used for digital storage.</a> Increasingly, the IT professional need not be concerned with the physical infrastructure used for storing data. As we will cover in the next section, storage increasingly is experienced as a virtual resource, accessed through executing programmed logic on Cloud platforms. "Underneath the covers" the Cloud provider might be using various forms of storage, from RAM to solid state drives to tapes, but the end user is,  <strong>ideally</strong>, shielded from the implementation details (part of the definition of a service).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it is important to understand that in general, storage follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy">hierarchy</a>. Just as we might "store" a document by holding it in our hands, setting it on a desktop, filing it in a cabinet, or archiving it in a banker&#8217;s box in an offsite warehouse, so computer storage also has different levels of speed and accessibility. If this is unfamiliar, see Wikipedia or research on your own; you should have a basic grasp of this issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Network</strong>
We can change the state of some data, or store it. We also need to move it. This is the basic concern of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">networking</a>, to transmit data (or information) from one location to another. If you use your cell phone to look up your bank balance, there is network involved - otherwise, how did the data get from the bank&#8217;s computer in New Jersey to your cell phone in Minnesota?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Networking is fairly intuitive; you may be familiar with coaxial cables for TV, or telephone lines strung from pole to pole in many areas. However, like storage, there is also a hierarchy of networking:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Intra-chip pathways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard">Motherboard</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backplane">backplane</a> circuits</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbone_network">Backbone networks</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like storage, networking as a service increasingly is independent of implementation. The developer uses programmatic tools to define expected information transmission, and (again <strong>ideally</strong>) need not be concerned with the specific networking technologies or architectures serving their needs.</p>

Eventually, scale matters. As your IT service&#8217;s usage increases, you will inevitably find that you need to start caring about technical details such as storage and network architecture.<br>
<br>
The implementation decisions made by you and your service providers may become inefficient for the particular "workload" your product represents, and you will need to start asking questions. This will be discussed in more depth in the Cloud chapter.<br>

<p>There is ferocious turbulence in the IT infrastructure market. Cloud technologies, DevOps, various platform wars… As an entrepreneur, you need to understand what technical trends matter and what are more of same.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, you will need to make some level of commitment to your technical architecture. And at some point you <strong>WILL</strong> be asked, “You’re still using that old technology?”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a startup, you have a couple initial decisions to make regarding infrastructure and tools:</p>

<p>What is my vision for bringing my product to the world?</p>

<p>As a startup, it would seem likely that you would use a commodity cloud provider. This text is based on this assumption (physical IT asset management will be discussed in Sections 3 and 4), but is there any reason why that would not work for you?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two questions are related. If you want to develop on a LAMP stack, you need a Cloud provider that will support you in this. While most are very flexible, you will need to consider the specific support levels they are offering; a provider that supports the platform (and not just the operating system) might be more valuable, but there may be higher costs and other tradeoffs.</p>

<p>Your system will be built, at least in part, with some form of programming language which is human-readable and compiled or interpreted into binary instructions.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Your computing environment is networked in a standard way.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assume a simple, physical computer such as a laptop:</p>

<p>When the laptop is first turned on, the operating system (OS) loads; the OS is itself software, but is able to directly control the computer&#8217;s physical resources: its CPU, memory, screen, and any interfaces such as WiFi, USB, and Bluetooth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The operating system (in a traditional approach) then is used to run "applications" such as Web browsers, media players, word processors, spreadsheets, and the like. Many such programs can also be run as applications within the browser, but the browser still needs to be run as an application.</p>

<p>In the simplest form of virtualization, a specialized application known as a hypervisor is loaded like any other application. The purpose of this hypervisor is to emulate the hardware computer in software. Once the hypervisor is running, it can emulate any number of "virtual" computers, each of which can have its own operating system. The hypervisor mediates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">"virtual machine"</a> (VM) access to the actual, physical hardware of the laptop; the VM can take input from the USB port, and output to the Bluetooth interface, just like the master OS that launched when the laptop was turned on.</p>

<p>There are two different kinds of hypervisors. The example we just discussed was an example of a Type 2 hypervisor, which runs on top of a host operating system. In a Type 1 hypervisor, a master host OS is not used; the hypervisor runs on the "bare metal" of the computer and in turn "hosts" multiple VMs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Paravirtualization is another form of virtualization found in the marketplace. In a paravirtualized environment, a core operating system is able to abstract hardware resources for multiple virtual guest environments without having to virtualize hardware for each guest. The benefit of this type of virtualization is increased I/O efficiency and performance for each of the guest environments.
However, while hypervisors can support a diverse array of virtual machines with different operating systems on a single computing node, guest environments in a paravirtualized system generally share a single OS.</p>

<p>While the conceptual idea of Cloud and utility computing was foreseeable fifty years ago, it took many years of hard-won IT evolution to support the vision. Reliable hardware of exponentially increasing performance, robust open-source software, Internet backbones of massive speed and capacity, and many other factors converged towards this end.</p>

Virtualization was predicted in the earliest theories that led to the development of computers. Turing and Church realized that any general purpose computer could emulate any other. Virtual systems have existed in some form since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_virtualization_development">at latest 1967</a> - only 20 years after the first fully functional computers.<br>

And yes, you can run computers within computers within computers with virtualization. They get slower and slower the more levels you go in, but the logic still works.

<p>In order to run compute as a utility, multi-tenancy was essential. This is different from electricity (but similar to the phone system). As noted elsewhere, one watt of electric power is like any other and there is less concern for leakage or unexpected interactions. People&#8217;s bank balances are not encoded somehow into the power generation and distribution infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, people store data - often private - on computers. In order to deliver compute as a utility, it is essential to segregate each customer&#8217;s workload from all others. This is called multi-tenancy. In multi-tenancy, multiple customers share physical resources that provide the illusion of being dedicated.</p>

<p>Virtualization attracted business attention as a means to consolidate computing workloads. For years, companies would purchase servers to run applications of various sizes, and in many cases the computers were badly underutilized. Because of configuration issues (legitimate) and an overabundance of caution (questionable), average utilization in a pre-virtualization data center might average 10%. (That&#8217;s 90% of the computer&#8217;s capacity being wasted.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The computing and storage infrastructure supporting each application stack in the business were sized properly to support each workload. For example, a payroll server might run on a different infrastructure configuration than a data warehouse server. Large enterprises needed to support hundreds of different infrastructure configurations, increasing maintenance and support costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The adoption of virtualization allowed businesses to compress multiple application workloads onto a smaller number of physical servers. In most virtualized architectures, the physical servers supporting workloads shared a consistent configuration, which made it easy to add and remove resources from the environment. Virtualization introduced a new design pattern into the enterprise where computing and storage infrastructure became commoditized building blocks supporting an ever-increasing array of services.</p>

<h4 id="_infrastructure_as_code">Infrastructure as code</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what is infrastructure as code?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As cloud infrastructures have scaled, there has been an increasing need to configure many servers identically. Auto-scaling (adding more servers in response to increasing load) has become a widely used strategy as well. Both call for increased automation in the provisioning of IT infrastructure. It is simply not possible for a human being to be hands on at all times in configuring and enabling such infrastructures, so automation is called for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In years past, infrastructure administrators relied on ad-hoc issuance of commands either at an operations console, or via a GUI-based application. Shell scripts might be used for various repetitive processes, but administrators by tradition and culture were empowered to issue arbitrary commands to alter the state of the running system directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following passage from The Phoenix Project captures some of the issues. The speaker is Wes, the infrastructure manager, who is discussing a troubleshooting scenario:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>“Several months ago, we were three hours into a Sev 1 outage, and we bent over backward not to escalate to Brent. But eventually, we got to a point where we were just out of ideas, and we were starting to make things worse. So, we put Brent on the problem.” He shakes his head, recalling the memory, “He sat down at the keyboard, and it’s like he went into this trance. Ten minutes later, the problem is fixed. Everyone is happy and relieved that the system came back up. But then someone asked, ‘How did you do it?’ And I swear to God, Brent just looked back at him blankly and said, ‘I have no idea. I just did it.’”</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Kim, Gene; Behr, Kevin ; Spafford, George (2013-01-10). The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win (p. 116). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obviously (and as discussed in the Phoenix Project), “close your eyes and go into a trance” is not a repeatable process. It is not a procedure or operation that can be archived and distributed across multiple servers. So, shell scripts or more advanced forms of automation are written and increasingly, all actual server configuration is based on such pre-developed specification. It is becoming more and more rare for a systems administrator to actually “log in” to a server and execute configuration-changing commands in an ad-hoc manner (as Brent).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, because virtualization is becoming so powerful, servers increasingly are destroyed and rebuilt at the first sign of any trouble. In this way, it is certain that the server’s configuration is as intended. This again is a relatively new practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Previously, because of the expense and complexity of bare-metal servers, and the cost of having them offline, great pains were taken to fix troubled servers. Systems administrators would spend hours or days troubleshooting obscure configuration problems, such as residual settings left by removed software. Certain servers might start to develop “personalities.” Industry practice has changed dramatically here since around 2010.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_a_simple_infrastructure_as_code_example">A simple infrastructure as code example</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note, the below section is illustrative only, and is not intended as a lab. The associated lab for this book goes into much more depth on these topics.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In presenting infrastructure as code at its simplest, we will start with the concept of a shell script. While this is not a deep Linux book (there are many others out there, starting with the excellent O’Reilly lineup), some basic technical literacy is assumed in this book.
Consider the following set of commands:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ mkdir foo
$ cd foo
$ touch x y z
$ cd ..
$ mkdir bar
$ cd bar
$ touch a b c</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What does this do? It tells the computer, “Create two directories, one named foo and one named bar. In the one named foo, create three blank files named x,y, and z; in the one named bar, create three blank files, named a, b, and c.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you find yourself (with the appropriate permissions) at a Unix command prompt, and run those commands, you will wind up with a configuration that could be visualized as this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/1.02-iac.png" alt="1.02 iac">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(If you don’t understand this, you should probably spend a couple hours with a Linux tutorial).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Configuration, you ask? Something this trivial? Yes, directory and file layouts count as configuration and in some cases are critical.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, what if we take that same set of commands, and put them in a file thus:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>#!/bin/bash
mkdir foo
cd foo
touch x y z
cd ..
mkdir bar
cd bar
touch a b c</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We might name that file iac.sh, set its permissions correctly, and run it (so that the computer executes all the commands for us, rather than us running them one at a time at the console).  If we did so in an empty directory, we’d again wind up with that same configuration. (If we did it in a directory already containing foo and bar directories, we’d get errors. More on this to come.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will be familiar material to many of you, including the fact that beyond creating directories and files we can use shell scripts to create and destroy virtual servers, install and remove software, set up and delete users, check on the status of running processes, and much more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The state of the art in infrastructure configuration is not to use shell scripts at all but rather policy-based infrastructure management approaches &#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>describe modern infra managers, policy management, auto-scaling as an example, provide an example Chef script..</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s return to our iac.sh file. It’s valuable. It documents our intentions for how this configuration should look. We can reliably run it on thousands of machines and it will always give us two directories and six files. In terms of the previous section, we might choose to run it on every new server we create. We want to establish it as a known resource in our technical ecosystem. This is where version control comes in.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, because this is a general book on IT management, we’re going to take a bit of a different turn here. As mentioned previously, there are numerous sources available to you to learn Linux scripting, policy-based configuration management of infrastructure, and source control. Competency with source control is essential to your career and you should devote some serious time to it. This book has a different purpose: to orient you to the fundamental principles and architectures of IT management at all scales.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are going to take a very deep and targeted look at source control (aka software configuration management) because it is here that we start to see the emergence of an architecture of IT management. It is in the source control system that we first start to see metadata emerge as an independent concern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(For a definition of metadata, see the sidebar.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of a software version control system (variously known as source control, revision control, software configuration management, and other terms) is our first major software system for the “business of IT.” (The virtualization architecture previously discussed is what is under management; the source control system is part of the management architecture.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The evolution of version control systems to the pivotal role they now hold has been somewhat unexpected. While version control was always deemed important for software artifacts, it has only recently become the preferred paradigm for managing infrastructure state as well.  Because of this, a version control system is easily and without question the first IT management system you should acquire and implement.</p>

<br>
"Version control" also includes what we will cover as package management: the management of binary files, as distinct from human-understandable symbolic files.
</td>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Source control works like a really advanced file system. It can remember all the changes you make to its contents, tell you the differences between any two versions, and also bring back the version you had at any point in time.
Source control, as you may imagine, is critical for any kind of system with complex, changing content, especially when many people are working on that content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can find many references to source control on the Internet and in books such as <em>Pro Git</em> by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. As it is the most important foundational technology for professional IT, whether in a garage or in the largest corporations, you need to have a deep familiarity with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Source control is at its most powerful when dealing with symbolic data, which we usually see as text files. It is less useful in dealing with unstructured, binary data, such as image files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is because symbolic files can be “differenced” in a way that is meaningful to humans. If I change “abc” to “abd” it is clear that the third character has been changed from “c” to “d.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, if I take a picture (e.g. as a JPEG file) and alter one pixel, and compare the resulting before and after binary files in terms of their data, it would be more difficult to understand what had changed. I would be able to easily tell that they are two different files (they would have different checksums), but they would look very similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT starts with symbolic files. Text editors create source code, scripts, and configuration files. These may be transformed in defined ways (e.g. by compilers and build tools) but the human understandable end of the process is mostly based on text files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We care very much about when a text file changes. One wrong character can completely alter the behavior of a large, complex system. Therefore, our configuration management approach must track to that level of detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although implementation details may differ, all version control systems have some concept of “commit.”
As stated in Version Control with Git:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>In Git, a commit is used to record changes to a repository  . . . Every Git commit represents a single, atomic changeset with respect to the previous state. Regardless of the number of directories, files, lines, or bytes that change with a commit… either all changes apply or none do. In terms of the underlying object model, atomicity just makes sense: A commit snapshot represents the total set of modified files and directories…  Git doesn’t care why files are changing. That is, the content of the changes doesn’t matter. As the developer, you might move a function from here to there and expect this to be handled as one unitary move. But you could, alternatively, commit the removal and then later commit the addition. Git doesn’t care. It has nothing to do with the semantics of what is in the files.</em></p>

<p>(Loeliger, Jon; McCullough, Matthew (2012-08-14). Version Control with Git: Powerful tools and techniques for collaborative software development (Kindle Locations 1520-1528). O&#8217;Reilly Media. Kindle Edition.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of a “commit” is a rich foundation for IT management and governance. It both represents the state of the computing system as well as providing evidence of the human activity surrounding it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we will see in Chapter 3, the “commit” identifier is directly referenced by build activity, which in turn is referenced by the release activity, which is typically visible across the IT value chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, the concept of an atomic “commit” is essential to the concept of a “branch” - the creation of an experimental version, completely separate from the main version, so that various alterations can be tried without compromising the overall system stability. Starting at the point of a “commit,” the branched version also becomes evidence of human activity around a potential future for the system. In some environments, the branch is automatically created with the assignment of a requirement or story - again, more on this to come in chapter 3.  In other environments, the very concept of branching is avoided.</p>

<h5 id="_sidebar_what_is_metadata">Sidebar: What is metadata?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An understanding of the term "metadata" is required for this book&#8217;s approach to IT management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Metadata is a tricky term, that tends to generate confusion. The term “meta” implies a concept that is somehow self-referential, and/or operating at a higher level of abstraction. So,</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the term meta-discussion is a discussion about the discussion;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meta-cognition is cognition about cognition, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meta-data (aka metadata) is data about data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In traditional data management, metadata is the description of the data structures, especially from a business point of view. A database column might be named “CUST_L_NM,” but the business description or metadata would be “The given last, family, or surname of the customer.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In document management, the document metadata is the record of who created the document and when, when it was last updated, and so forth. Failure to properly sanitize document metadata has led to various privacy and data security related issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In telephony,  “data” is the actual call signal — the audio of the phone conversation, nowadays usually digitally encoded. Metadata on the other hand is all the information about the call: from who to who, when, how long, and so forth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In computer systems, metadata can be difficult to isolate. Sometimes, computing professionals will speak of a “metadata” layer that may define physical database structures, data extracts, business process behavior, even file locations. The trouble is, from a computer’s point of view, a processing instruction is an instruction, and the prefix “meta” has no real meaning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of this, I favor a principle that <strong>metadata is by definition non-runtime.</strong> It is documentation, usually represented as structured or semi-structured data, but not usually a primary processing input or output. It might be “digital exhaust” - log files are a form of metadata. It is not executable. If it’s executable, it’s digital logic or configuration, plain and simple.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what about our infrastructure as code example? The artifact - the configuration file, the script - is NOT metadata, because it is executable. But the source repository commit IS metadata. It has no meaning for the script. The dependency is one way - without the artifact, the commit ID is meaningless, but the artifact is completely ignorant of the commit. However, the commit may become an essential data point for human beings trying to make sense of the state of a resource defined by that artifact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>In this microcosm, we see the origins of IT management.</strong>
It is not always easy to apply this approach in practice. There can be edge cases. But <strong>the concept of metadata provides a basis for distinguishing the <em>management</em> of information technology from the actual <em>practice</em> of information technology.</strong></p>

Structured Query Language (SQL) statements are a great example of a declarative approach. We can provide a database system with a set of SQL statements, and the database will generate an execution plan to provide us with the data we are seeking.

<p>Books and articles are written every week about some aspect of IT infrastructure. We have only scratched the surface in our discussions of compute, network, and storage, and how they have become utility services in the guise of Cloud.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service - each represents a different approach. For the most part, we will focus on Infrastructure as a Service in the remainder of this book, on the assumption that your digital product is unique enough to need the broad freedom this provides.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT infrastructure is a rich and complex topic, and a person can spend their career specializing in it. For this class, we always want to keep chapter 1 in mind: why do we want it? How does it provide for our needs, contribute to our enjoyment?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have some idea of IT value (and how we might turn it into a product), and have decided on some infrastructure, we can start building.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT systems that directly create value for non-technical users are usually called "applications," or sometimes "services." As discussed in chapter 1, they enable value experiences in areas as diverse as consumer banking, entertainment and hospitality, and personal transportation. In fact it is difficult to think of any aspect of modern life untouched by applications. (This overall trend is sometimes called digital transformation.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications are built from software, the development of which is a core concern for any IT-centric product strategy. Software development is a well established career, and a fast-moving field with new technologies, frameworks, and schools of thought emerging weekly, it seems.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter will cover applications and the software lifecycle, from requirements through construction, testing, building, and deployment into modern production environments.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In keeping with our commitment to theory and first principles, we use an engineering definition of "application." To an electrical engineer, a toaster or a light bulb is an "application" of electricity. Similarly, a customer relationship management system, or a Web video on demand service, are "applications" of the core computer infrastructure we studied in the last chapter.</p>

<p><em>Public domain photo of early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a> computer from Wikipedia. ENIAC was "programmed" by reconfiguring its cables, not by a programming language.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without applications, computers would be merely a curiousity. Computers were first "applied" to military needs for codebreaking and artillery calculations. After World War II, ex-military officers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Berkeley">Edmund Berkeley</a> at Prudential realized their potential if "applied" to problems like insurance record keeping. <a href="#Akera2007">[Akera2007]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At first, such systems required actual manual configuration (as in the ENIAC photo in this section), or painstaking programming in complex, tedious, and unforgiving low-level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming languages</a>. As the value of computers became obvious, investment was made in making programming easier through more powerful languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_software">history of software</a> is well documented. Low level languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code">binary</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code">assembler</a>) were increasingly replaced by higher level languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">FORTAN</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>). Proprietary machine/language combinations were replaced by open standards and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compilers</a> that could take a common set of source code and build it for different hardward platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today, we have extensive frameworks like Struts and Ruby on Rails, along with interpreted languages that take much of the friction out of building and testing code. But even today, the objective remains to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable">binary executable</a> file or files that computer hardware can "execute," that is, turn into a computing-based value experience, mediated through devices such as workstations, laptops, smart phones, and their constituent components.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_applications_and_infrastructure_the_old_way">Applications and infrastructure: the old way</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first decades of computing, any significant application of computing power to a new problem typically required its own <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_infrastructure_overview">infrastructure</a>, often designed specifically for the problem. While computer scientists always were aware that computers in theory could be "general purpose," in practice this was not so easy. Military/aerospace needs differed from industry, which differed from scientific and technical uses. And major new applications required new compute capacity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take for example when a corporation in 1998 decided to replace its mainframe Human Resources system due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K concerns</a>. Such a system might need to support several thousand users around the world. At that time, PeopleSoft was a frequent choice of software. Implementing such a system was often led by consulting firms such as Deloitte or Andersen Consulting (where the author worked).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A typical PeopleSoft package implementation would include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeopleSoft">PeopleSoft</a> software, including the PeopleTools framework and various modules written in the framework (e.g. the well-regarded PeopleSoft HR system)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle database</a> software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AT&amp;T "Tuxedo" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_processing">transaction manager</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autosys <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_scheduler">job scheduler</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX">HP-UX operating system</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HP-UX servers, perhaps 20 or so, comprising various "environments" including a production "cluster" consisting of application and database servers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMC_Corporation">EMC</a> storage array</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various ancillary software and hardware: management utilities and scripts, backup, networking, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customization of the PeopleSoft HR module and reports by hired consultants, to meet the requirements of the acquiring organization</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The software and hardware needed to be specified in keeping with requirements, and acquiring it took lengthy negotiations and logistics and installation processes. Such a project from inception to production might take 9 months (on the short side) to 18 or more months.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hardware was dedicated and rarely re-used. The HP servers compatible with PeopleSoft might have few other applications, if they became surplus. In fact, PeopleSoft would "certify" the infrastructure for compatibility. Upgrading the software might require also upgrading the hardware.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In essence, this was more akin to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering">systems engineering</a>, as designing and optimizing the hardware component was a significant portion of the work.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today, matters are quite different, and yet echoes of the older model persist. As mentioned, ANY  compute workloads are going to incur economic cost. However, capacity is being used more efficiently and can be provisioned on demand. Currently, it is a significant application indeed that merits its own systems engineering.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, a variety of mechanisms (as covered in the previous chapter&#8217;s <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_from_physical_compute_to_cloud">discussion of Cloud systems</a>) enable the sharing of compute capacity, the raw material of application development. The fungibility and agility of these mechanisms increase the velocity of creation and evolution of application software.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For small and medium sized applications, the overwhelming trend is to virtualize and run on  commodity hardware and operating systems. Even 15 years ago, non-trivial web sites with database integration would be hosted by internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a> clusters at major enterprises (for example, Microsoft ASP, COM+, and SQL Server clusters could be managed as multi-tenant).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general purpose capabilities of virtualized public and private Cloud today are robust. Assuming the organization has the financial capability to purchase computing capacity in anticipation of use, it can be instantly available when the need surfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interfaces (interaction points for applications to exchange information with each other, generally in an automated way) are increasingly standardized. Hardware engineering is more and more independent of the application lifecycle; the trend is towards providing compute as a service, carefully specified in terms of performance, but NOT particular hardware.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hardware physically dedicated to a single application is rarer, and even the largest engineered systems are more standardized so that they may one day benefit from Cloud approaches.</p>

<p>The design and architecture of applications is a large topic (see e.g. <a href="#Gamma1995">[Gamma1995]</a> and <a href="#Fowler2003">[Fowler2003]</a>) and this text only touches lightly on it. <a href="http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/defining-architecture.html">ISO/IEC 41010</a> defines architecture as “the fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.”</p>

<p>A computer program can be as simple as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">"Hello World."</a> Such a program requires only one or a few files to compile and execute.

Specialized visual notations are used to describe this complexity, as in the image above. We will discuss this further in Chapter 11.</p>

<h5 id="_applications_and_project_management">Applications and project management</h5>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not a book on software development per se, nor on Agile development. There are hundreds of books available on those topics. But, no assumption is made that the reader has any familiarity with these topics, so some basic history is called for. (If you have taken an introductory course in software engineering, this will likely be review.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we will cover in more detail in the next chapter, the product development process starts with a concept of requirements (whether we call it story, use case, or scenario is not important). Requirements are numerous and evolving, and we’re going to take some time looking at the process of converting them into IT-based functionality. There is history here back to the earliest days of computing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the author first joined Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) in 1998, we were schooled in something called the Business Integration Method, or BIM. The BIM was a classic expression of what is called “waterfall development".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is waterfall development? It is a controversial question. The original theorist who coined the term named it in order to critique it <a href="#Royce1970">[Royce1970]</a>. Military contracting and management consultancy practices, however, embraced it, as it provided an illusion of certainty. The fact that computer systems until recently included a substantial component of hardware systems engineering may also have contributed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Waterfall development as a term has become associated with a number of practices. The original illustration was similar to this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/1.03-waterfall.png" alt="1.03 waterfall">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, requirements need to be extensively captured and analyzed before the work of development should commence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, we would develop enormous spreadsheets of requirements, spending weeks on making sure that they represented what “the customer” wanted. The objective was to get the customer’s signature. Any further alterations could be profitably billed as “change requests".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The analysis phase was used to develop a more structured understanding of the requirements, e.g. conceptual and logical data models, process models, business rules, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the design phase, the actual technical platforms would be chosen; major subsystems determined with their connection points, initial volumetrics translated into system sizing, and so forth. (Perhaps hardware would not be ordered until this point, leading to issues with developers now being “ready”, but hardware not being available for weeks or months yet).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only AFTER extensive requirements, analysis, and design would coding take place (implementation). Furthermore, there were separation of duties between developers and testers. Developers would write code and testers would try to break it, filing bug reports that the developers would then need to respond to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another model sometimes encountered at this time was the V-model. This was intended to better represent the various levels of abstraction operating in the systems delivery activity. Requirements operate at various levels, from high level business intent through detailed specifications. It is all too possible that a system is “successfully” implemented at lower levels of specification, but fails to satisfy the original higher level intent.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/1.03-vmodel.png" alt="1.03 vmodel">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Public domain image of v-model from</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model_(software_development)"><em>Wikipedia</em></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The failures of these approaches at scale are by now well known. Large distributed teams would wrestle with thousands of requirements. The customer would “sign off” on multiple large binders, with widely varying degrees of understanding of what they were agreeing to. Documentation became an end in itself, and yet did not meet its objectives of ensuring continuity if staff turned over.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The development team would design and build out extensive product implementations without checking the results with customers. They would also defer testing that various component parts would effectively interoperate until the very end of the project, when the time came to assemble the whole system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Failure after failure of this approach is apparent in the historical record (<a href="#Glass1998">[Glass1998]</a>). This led to the perception of a “software crisis.”  (It should also be noted that many large systems were effectively constructed and operated during the "waterfall years", and that there are reasonable criticisms of the concept of a “software crisis” <a href="#Bossavit2015">[Bossavit2015]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Successful development efforts existed back to the earliest days of computing (otherwise, we probably wouldn’t have computers, or at least not so many). Many of these successful efforts used prototypes and other means of building understanding and proving out approaches. But highly publicized failures continued, and a substantial movement against “waterfall” development started to take shape.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the 1990s, a number of thought leaders in software development had noticed some common themes with what seemed to work and what didn’t. Perhaps the first and best known was Kent Beck, who developed a methodology known as “eXtreme Programming,” or XP <a href="#Beck2000">[Beck2000]</a>. XP pioneered the concepts of iterative, fast-cycle development with ongoing stakeholder feedback, coupled with test-driven development, ongoing refactoring, pair programming, and other practices. (More on the specifics of these in the next section.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Various authors assembled in 2001 and developed the Agile Manifesto <a href="#Alliance2001">[Alliance2001]</a>, which further emphasized an emergent set of values and practices:</p>

<p>The Agile models for developing software aligned with the rise of Cloud and Web-scale IT. As new customer-facing sites like Flickr, Amazon, Netflix, Etsy, and Facebook scaled to massive proportions, it become increasingly clear that waterfall approaches were incompatible with their needs. The sheer size and complexity of these systems required much more incremental and iterative approaches to delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, because these systems were directly user-facing, delivering monetized value, they required a degree of responsiveness previously not seen in “back-office” IT or military-aerospace domains (the major forms that large scale system development had taken to date).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web-based systems integrate the software development lifecycle tightly with operational concerns. The development of new functionality is moved rapidly into a user-facing state, as opposed to previous models where software development was more distant in time and personnel from operations staff. We will talk more of product-centricity and the overall DevOps movement in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software was moving more directly into an operational state, and developers and operators were part of the same economic concern (contract software development never gained favor in the Silicon Valley web-scale community). So, it was possible to start breaking down the walls between “development” and “operations,” and that is just what happened.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This new world also did not function at all in terms of large requirements specifications. Capturing a requirement, analyzing and designing to it, implementing it, testing that implementation, and deploying the result to the end user for feedback became something that needed to happen at speed, with high repeatability. Requirements "backlogs" were (and are) never "done," and increasingly were the subject of ongoing re-prioritization, without high-overhead project "change" barriers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These large scale web properties also started to “test in production” (more on this in Section 2) in the sense that they would deploy new functionality to only some of their users. Because large scale systems are complex and unpredictable, it is understood that new features are never fully understood until they are deployed at scale to the real end user base.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rather than trying to increase testing to better understand things before deployment, these new firms accepted a seemingly higher level of risk in exposing new functionality sooner. (Part of their belief is that it actually is not higher risk, because the impacts are never fully understood in any event.) This has paid off in many cases.</p>

<p>The implicit goal is that the organization should be able to change one line of code, and in fact might want to do so on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>The assumption in this chapter is that you are going to start IMMEDIATELY with a continuous delivery pipeline. <strong>You want to set this up before developing a single line of code.</strong> It’s not that difficult (see the online resources for further discussion and pointers to relevant open source projects).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is meant by a continuous delivery pipeline? Here is a simplified, starting overview, based on the <a href="https://github.com/CharlesTBetz/Calavera">Calavera project</a> (the basis for this course&#8217;s labs):</p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>First, some potential for value is identified. It is refined through product management techniques into a feature - some specific set of functionality that when complete will enable the value proposition (i.e. as a <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_it_services_systems_and_applications">moment of truth</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feature is expressed as some set of IT work, today usually in small increments lasting between 1 and 4 weeks (this of course varies). Software development commences, e.g. the creation of Java components by developers who first write tests, and then write code that satisfies the test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The developer is continually testing the software as the build progresses, and keeping a local source control repository up to date with their changes at all times. When she or he reaches a level of satisfaction with the software, it is submitted to a centralized source repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the repository detects the new "check-in," it launches a dedicated environment to build and test the new code. The environment is likely configured using <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_infrastructure_as_code">"infrastructure as code"</a> techniques; in this way, it can be created automatically and quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the code passes all tests, the compiled and built binary executables may then be "checked in" to a package management repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the package repository, the code may then be deployed to various environments, for further testing and ultimately to "production," where it can enable the consumer&#8217;s value experiences.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s go into more detail on the major phases.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_describing_system_intent">Describing system intent</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, you’ve got an idea for a product value experience, and you have tools for creating it and infrastructure for running it. It’s time to start building shippable product.
In order to do this, you need to express what you need the product to do. The conceptual tool used to do this is called Requirement.
The literal word “Requirement” has fallen out of favor with the rise of Agile <a href="#Patton2014">[Patton2014]</a>, and has a number of synonyms and variations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use case</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User story</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonfunctional requirement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architectural epic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architectural requirement</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While these may differ in terms of focus and scope, the basic concept is the same - the requirement, however named, expresses some intent or constraint the system must fulfill. This intent calls for work to be performed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As systems engineering approaches transform to Cloud and infrastructure as code, a large and increasing percentage of IT work takes the form of altering symbolic files and moving them between states. We have seen this in the previous chapter, with artifacts such as scripts being created to drive the provisioning and configuring of computing resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the intent leads to the artifact, and the artifact leads to the commit, it makes sense to associate the requirement with a branch in the version control system. This is not required, but makes it easier to trace the requirement to the actual work by which it was fulfilled. This will be discussed further in Section II and its associated labs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>User Story Mapping is a well known approach <a href="#Patton2014">[Patton2014]</a> with origins in the Scrum community. Here is an example from <a href="#Cohn2010">[Cohn2010]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"As a shopper, I can select how I want items shipped based on the actual costs of shipping to my address so that I can make the best decision."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic format is,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a &lt; type of user &gt;, I want &lt; goal &gt;, so that &lt; some value &gt;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The story concept is flexible, and can be aggregated and decomposed in various ways, as we will discuss in Chapter 4. Our interest here is in the basic stimulus for application development work that it represents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You don&#8217;t need an extensively automated system at this stage to capture requirements, but you need <strong>something</strong>. It could be a spreadsheet, or a shared word processing document, or sticky notes on a whiteboard (we&#8217;ll talk about Kanban in the next chapter.) The important thing is to start somewhere, with team agreement as to what the approach is, so you can move forward collaboratively.</p>

<p>In test-driven development, the idea essence is to write code that tests itself. This is done through the creation of test harnesses and the tight association of tests with requirements. The logical culmination of test-driven development was expressed by Kent Beck in <em>eXtreme Programming</em>: write the test first <a href="#Beck2000">[Beck2000]</a>. Thus:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Given a “user story” (i.e <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_describing_system_intent">system intent</a>), figure out a test that will demonstrate its successful implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write this test using the established testing framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the code that fulfills the test.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some readers may be thinking, “I know how to write a little code, but what is this about using code to write a test?”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While we avoid much in-depth examination of source code in this book, using some simplified Java will help. Here is an example drawn from the  <a href="https://github.com/CharlesTBetz/Calavera">Calavera project</a>, the basis for the companion labs to this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s say we want a function that will take a string of characters (e.g. a sentence) and wrap it in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> “Heading 1” tags. We will name the class “H1Class” and (by convention) we will start by developing a class called TestH1Class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We write the test first:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>public class TestClass1 {
 private H1Class a;  //
 @Before
 public void setUp() throws Exception {
  this.a = new H1Class("TestWebMessage");
 }
 @Test
  public void testTrue() {
    assertEquals("string correctly generated",
     "&lt;h1&gt;TestWebMessage&lt;/h1&gt;",
     this.a.webMessage());// string built correctly
  }
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code above basically states,</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Set up the object to be tested</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pass in a message with the content "TestWebMessage"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the test passess if we get back "&lt;h1&gt;TestWebMessage&lt;/h1&gt;" - the original message surrounded by &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt; "tags," which are part of HTML.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We run the test (e.g. through Junit and Ant, which we won&#8217;t detail here). It will fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, we write the class:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre> public class H1Class {
  String strMsg;
  public String webMessage()
    {
      return "&lt;h1&gt;" + strMsg + "&lt;/h1&gt;";
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we run the test harness correctly (e.g. using a build tool such as Ant or Maven), the test class will perform the following actions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>create an instance of the class H1Class, based on a string “TestWebMessage”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>confirm that the returned string is “&lt;h1&gt;TestWebMessage&lt;/h1&gt;”</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If that string is not correctly generated, or the class cannot be created, or any other error occurs, the test fails and this is then reported via error results at the console, or (in the case of automated build) will be detected by the build manager and displayed as the build outcome.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other languages use different approaches from that shown here, but every serious platform at this point supports test-driven development.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
_Refactoring is a controlled technique for improving the design of an existing code base. Its essence is applying a series of small behavior-preserving transformations, each of which is "too small to be worth doing". However, the cumulative effect of each of these transformations is quite significant. By doing them in small steps you reduce the risk of introducing errors. You also avoid having the system broken while you are carrying out the restructuring - which allows you to gradually refactor a system over an extended period of time. _

<p>Test-driven development enables the next major practice, that of refactoring. Refactoring is how you address technical debt. What is technical debt? Technical debt is defined by Wikipedia as</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>…the eventual consequences of poor system design, software architecture or software development within a codebase. The debt can be thought of as work that needs to be done before a particular job can be considered complete or proper. If the debt is not repaid, then it will keep on accumulating interest, making it hard to implement changes later on. Unaddressed technical debt increases software entropy.
Analogous to monetary debt, technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometime technical debt is required to move projects forward.

<h4 id="_continuous_integration">Continuous integration</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term “continuous integration” was popularized by Paul Duvall in his book of the same name <a href="#Duvall2007">[Duvall2007]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to understand why continuous integration is important, it is necessary to further discuss the concept of source control and how it is employed in real world settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine you have been working for some time with your partner in your startup (or on your small team) and you have three code modules. You are writing the web front end (file set A), your partner is writing the administrative tools and reporting (file set B), and you both partner on the data access layer (file set C).
The conflict of course arises on the file set C that you both need to work on.  A and B are mostly independent of each other, but changes to any part of C can have an impact on both your modules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If changes are frequently needed to C, and yet you cannot split it into logically separate modules, you have a problem; you cannot both work on the same file at the same time. You also are concerned that the other person does not introduce changes into C that “break” the code in your module A.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In smaller environments, or under older practices, perhaps there is no conflict, or perhaps you can agree to take turns. But even if you are taking turns, you still need to test your code in A to make sure it’s not been broken by changes your partner made in C.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And what if you really both need to work on C at the same time?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might each choose to work on C on your own local copy. That way, you can move ahead on your local workstation. But when the time comes to combine both of your work, you will be in "merge hell." You may have chosen very different approaches to solving the same problem, and code may need massive revision to settle on one code base.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[TODO: add graphics]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These problems have driven the evolution of software configuration management for decades. In previous methods, to develop a new release, the code would be copied into a very long-lived branch. Ongoing “maintenance” fixes of the existing code base would also continue, and the two code bases would inevitably diverge. Switching over to the “new” code base might mean that once-fixed bugs (bugs that had been addressed by maintenance activities) would show up again, and of course this would not be acceptable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, when the newer development was complete, it would need to be merged back into the older line of code, and this was rarely if ever easy. In a worst case scenario, the new development might have to be redone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enter continuous integration. The key practices include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Source control (hopefully we have been harping on this enough that you are taking it seriously by now). Distributed version control systems such as git are especially popular, although older centralized products are <a href="http://bitquabit.com/post/unorthodocs-abandon-your-dvcs-and-return-to-sanity/">starting to adopt some of their functionality</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test-driven development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated build activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequent integration of short-lived development branches with the main code repository (“mainline” or “trunk”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A defined package repository as a definitive location for the build output.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Current practices are well developed and represent a highly evolved understanding gained through the painful trial and error of many development teams over many years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rather than locking C so that only one person can work on it at a time, it’s been found that the best approach is to allow developers to actually make multiple copies of such a file or file set and work on them simultaneously. Wait, you say. How can that work?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the principle of continuous integration at work. If the developers are continually pulling each other’s work into their own working copies, and continually testing that nothing has broken, then distributed development can take place. So, if you are a developer, the day’s work might be as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>8 AM: check out files from master source repository to a local branch on your workstation. Because files are not committed unless they pass all tests, you know that you are checking out clean code. You pull user story (requirement) that you will now develop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>8:30 AM: You define a test and start developing the code to fulfill it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>10 AM: You are closing in on wrapping up the first requirement. You check the source repository. Your partner has checked in some new code, so you pull it down to your local repository. You run all the automated tests and nothing breaks, so you’re fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>10:30: You complete your first update of the day; it passes all tests on your workstation. You commit it to the master repository. The master repository is continually monitored by the build server, which takes the code you created and deploys it, along with all necessary configurations, to a dedicated build server (which might be just a virtual machine or transient container). All tests pass there (the test you defined as indicating success for the module, as well as a host of older tests that are routinely run whenever the code is updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>11:00: Your partner pulls your changes into their working directory. Unfortunately, some changes you made conflict with some work they are doing. You briefly consult and figure out a mutually acceptable approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a continuously evolving problem area, with practices changing rapidly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_continuous_deployment">Continuous deployment</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, assuming that continuous integration is running effectively, one can take the last mile step and deploy the now tested and built software to pre-production or production environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, the software can undergo user testing, load testing, integration testing, and so forth. Once those tests are passed, it can be deployed to production.
(What is “production,” anyway? We’ll talk about environments in Section 2. For now, you just need to know that when an IT-based product is “in production,” that means it is live and available to its intended base of end users or customers.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moving new code into production has always been a risky procedure. Changing a running system always entails some uncertainty. However, the practice of infrastructure as code coupled with increased virtualization has reduced the risk. Often, a rolling release strategy is employed so that code is deployed to small sets of servers while other servers continue to service the load. This requires careful design to allow the new and old code to co-exist at least for a brief time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once software is compiled and built, the executable files that can be installed and run operationally should be checked into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">Package Manager</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is important so that the versions of software used in producton are well controlled and consistent. The package manager can then be associated with some kind of deploy tool that keeps track of what versions are associated with which infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Timing varies by organization. Some strive for true "continuous deployment," in which the new code flows seamlessly from developer commit through build, test, package and deploy. Others put gates in between the developer and check-in to mainline, or source to build, or package to deploy, so that some human governance remains in the toolchain. We will go into more detail on these topics in chapters 6, 9, and 10.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications are why computers exist. Supporting applications increasingly is less about systems engineering, and more about quickly provisioning standard, shared infrastructure. Application development has moved decisively in the past twenty years to Agile delivery models, based on techniques such as:</p>

<h3 id="_section_i_conclusion">Section I Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are now at the end of the first section, and one quarter the way through this book (and this course, assuming you are taking a semester long treatment).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are now the proud master or mistress of a functioning startup. You have decided to provide some product that at least partially depends on an IT-based component that you need to actively develop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You understand the value that IT brings, and your own product’s needs for it. You have chosen at least a functioning platform for initial development, without falling into the trap of analysis paralysis, although at this point you should be keeping your options open if your initial platform choice doesn’t prove out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you have implemented at least a lightweight continuous delivery pipeline. You didn’t need to spend any money doing this, as so much powerful technology is freely available. In particular, from the start you have taken version control very seriously and have a stable, backed up source repository as a basis for your product development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also have at least rudimentary systems for tracking requirements, building your software, storing your packages, and deploying them to your production environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Congratulations, you’ve got all the basics in place. Your product is starting to attract sales and/or investors, and you’ve hired a few more people. Let’s talk about collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Staying at Level 1</strong>
In your career, many - perhaps even the majority - of the people you meet and work with will be focused on Level 1 in their thinking and approach. This is a fine thing and to be expected. Level 1 is where the real work is done.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scenario</strong>
You are part of a tight-knit team. You’ve moved out of the garage into a more professionalized environment. You might not all be in the same room, but you have a single mission and a cohesive culture, and you don’t need a lot of overhead to get the job done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your startup has met with some success and you are now a team - still small enough to be fed by two pizzas, if people aren&#8217;t that hungry. Even with a few new people comes the need to more clearly establish your product direction, so people are building the right thing. You&#8217;re all in the same location, and can still communicate informally, but there is enough going on that you need a more organized approach to getting work done. Finally, this great thing you&#8217;re building doesn&#8217;t mean much if it&#8217;s not running right and people can&#8217;t get to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, things are getting larger and more complex. You have a significant user base, and your founder is increasingly out meeting with users, customers and investors; she isn’t in the room with the product team as much any more… in fact, she just named someone to be “product owner” and what is that all about?</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember in Chapter 1 we talked of the user&#8217;s <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/images/1.01-ITStack2.png">value experience</a>, and also how services <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_the_it_service_lifecycle">evolve over time in a lifecycle</a>?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two primary value experiences:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The value the user derives from the service (e.g. account lookups, or a flawless navigational experience)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value the investor derives from monetizing the product, or comparable incentives (e.g. nonprofit missions)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, the product team derives career value. This becomes more of a factor later in the game. We will discuss this further in chapter 7 on organization, and Chapter 11 on architecture lifecycles &amp; technical debt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The product team receives feedback from both value experiences. The day to day interactions with the service (e.g. help desk and operations) are understood, and (typically on a more intermittent basis) the portfolio investor also feeds back the information to the product team (the boss&#8217;s boss comes for a visit).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is of course a simplified model, and in a large enterprise both the users and investors may have proxies (more on this to come).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The figure above is an architectural representation of the toolchain we started to develop in Section 1. The toolchain can be seen as part of a value chain that is delivering an IT service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we will look at:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>How you are accepting and executing on feedback signals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How the feedback relationship with your investors is evolving, in terms of your product direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How the feedback relationship with your users is evolving, in terms of both operational criteria and product direction</p>

<p>We will discuss work management, product management, shared mental models, visualization, and systems monitoring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 4: Product Management</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You (as the startup leader) are spending more time with investors and customers, and maintaining alignment around your original product vision is becoming more challenging as you are pulled in various directions. You need some means of keeping the momentum here. And the concept of "product management," you&#8217;re finding, represents a rich set of ideas for managing your team&#8217;s efforts at this stage of the game.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 5: Work Management</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even with a small team of 5 people (let alone 8 or 9), it&#8217;s too easy for balls to get dropped as work moves between key contributors. You probably don&#8217;t need a complex software-based process management tool yet, but you do need some way of managing work in process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 6: Operations Management</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since Chapter 3, your application developers have been running your systems and even answering the occasional phone call from customers. You&#8217;re big enough that you need a bit more specialization. You&#8217;ve got dedicated support staff answering the phone calls and you are finding that, even if you rotate operational responsibilities across developers, it is still a distinct kind of "interrupt-driven" work that is not compatible with heads-down, focused software development.</p>

<h4 id="_a_brief_introduction_to_feedback">A brief introduction to feedback</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the term "information systems (IS)" was widely replaced by "information technology (IT)" in the 1990s, do not be fooled. Enterprise IT is a complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system">sociotechnical system</a>, that delivers the digital services to support a myriad of other complex sociotechnical systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Merriam-Webster <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/system">defines a system</a> as "a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole". These interactions and relationships quickly take center stage as you move from individual work to team efforts. Consider that while a 2 member team only has 1 relationship to worry about, a 10 member team has 45, and a 100 person team has 4,950!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the Senge quote implies, brute force does not scale well within the context of a system. Systems tend to make their own rules. Within the bounds of the system, actions lead to outcomes, which in turn affect future actions. This <strong>feedback</strong> often becomes amplified and re-amplified through the systems' interactions with itself, until an overload occurs, such as the horrible screeching of a microphone too close to a speaker. In the business world, these feedback loops can manifest themselves in rigid platforms, brittle applications, or even a toxic work culture that sabotages success.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A thorough discussion of systems theory is beyond the scope of this book. However, many of the ideas that follow are informed by it. Obtaining a working knowledge of systems theory will not only enhance your understanding of this book, it can also be an essential tool for managing uncertainty in your future career, teams, and organizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_defining_feedback_with_examples">Defining feedback, with examples</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Feedback is a loaded term. We hear terms like positive feedback and negative feedback, and associate it quickly with performance coaching and management discipline. That is not the sense of feedback in this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The definition of feedback as used in this book is based on engineering. There is considerable related theory in general engineering and especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a> and the reader is encouraged to investigate some of these foundations if unfamiliar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the classic illustration of a feedback loop:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/feedback.png" alt="feedback">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, we can consider “rabbit reproduction” as a process with a positive feedback loop:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rabbits.png" alt="rabbits">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The more rabbits, the faster they reproduce, and the more rabbits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a “positive” feedback loop, although Mr. MacGregor the local gardener may not agree, given that they are eating all his cabbages!! This is why feedback experts (e.g. <a href="#Sterman2000">[Sterman2000]</a>) prefer to call this “reinforcing” feedback, because there is not necessarily anything “positive” about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can also consider feedback as the relationship between TWO processes:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/processAB.png" alt="processAB">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our rabbit example, what if Process B is fox reproduction, that is, the birth rate of foxes (who eat rabbits)?</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rabbitfox.png" alt="rabbitfox">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More rabbits equals more foxes (notice the “+” symbol on the line), because there are more rabbits to eat! But what does this do to the rabbits? It means LESS rabbits. Which, ultimately, means less foxes… and at some point, the populations balance. This is classic negative feedback. However, the local foxes don’t see it as negative (nor do the local gardeners!)  That is why feedback experts prefer to call this “balancing” feedback.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with bridges, at a technical level, reinforcing feedback can be a very bad thing in IT systems. In general, any process that is amplified without any balancing feedback will eventually consume itself and all its resources, just like rabbits will eat all the food available to them. So, if you create a process (e.g. write and run a computer program) that recursively spawns itself, it will sooner or later crash the computer as it devours memory and CPU. See <a href="http://osr507doc.sco.com/en/HANDBOOK/runaway_proc.html">Runaway processes.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Balancing feedback, on the other hand, is critical to make sure you are “staying on track.” Engineers use concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a>, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping">damping</a>, to keep bridges from falling down. Balancing feedback in a business and IT context takes a wide variety of forms:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The product owner clarifying for developers the precise user experience vision for the product, based on a demonstration of developer work in process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The end users calling to tell you the “system is slow” (or down)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The product owner or portfolio sponsor calling to tell you they are not satisfied with the system’s value</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, we see these two basic kinds of feedback:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Positive/Reinforcing, “do more of that”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negative/Balancing, “stop doing that,” “fix that”</p>

Still confused? Think about the last time you saw a "reply-all" email storm. The first accidental mass send generates feedback (emails saying "take me off this list"), which generate more emails ("stop emailing the list") and so on. This does not continue indefinitely; management intervention, common sense and fatigue eventually damp the storm down.

<h5 id="_open_vs_closed_loop_systems">Open vs closed loop systems</h5>

<p>Finally, we should talk briefly about open loop versus closed loop systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open loop systems have no regulation, no balancing feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Closed loop systems have some form of balancing feedback</p>

<p>In navigation terminology, the open-loop attempt to stick to a course without external information (e.g. navigating in the fog, without radar or communications) is known as " <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning">dead reckoning</a>," in part because it can easily get you dead!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good example of an open loop system is the children’s game “pin the tail on the donkey.” In “pin the tail on the donkey,” a person has to execute a process (pinning a paper or cloth "tail" onto a poster of a donkey - no live donkeys are involved!) while blindfolded, based on their memory of their location (and perhaps after being deliberately disoriented by spinning in circles).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since they are blindfolded, they have to move across the room and pin the tail without the ongoing corrective feedback of their eyes. (Perhaps they are getting feedback from their friends, but perhaps their friends are not reliable….)</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without the blindfold, it would be a closed loop system. The person would rise from their chair and, through the ongoing feedback of their eyes to their central nervous system, would move towards the donkey and pin the tail in the correct location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may seem obvious, but the history of IT management (some would say all management) over the past decades has been the struggle to overcome open-loop practices. Reliance on open-loop practices is arguably an indication of a dysfunctional command and control culture. A IT team that is designing and delivering without sufficient corrective feedback from its stakeholders is an ineffective, open-loop system. <a href="#Kennaley2010">[Kennaley2010]</a> applies these principles to software development in much greater depth, and is recommended.</p>

No system can ever be fully "open loop" indefinitely.  Sooner or later, you take off the blindfold, or wind up on the rocks. Mark Kennaley prefers the term "delayed feedback closed loop system" (personal correspondence, 9/2015).

<h4 id="_why_product_management">Why product management?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before work, before operations, there must be a vision of product. You already established a preliminary vision in Chapter 1, but now as your organization grows, you need to consider further how you will sustain that vision and establish an ongoing flow of work to realize it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like many other topics in this book, product management is a significant field in and of itself. Historically, product management has not been a major theme in enterprise IT management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT systems served narrow purposes, often “back office” functions such as accounting or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_requirements_planning">materials planning</a>. Mostly, such systems were managed as projects assembled on a temporary basis, resulting in the creation of a system to be “thrown over the wall” to operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product management, on the other hand, is concerned with the entire lifecycle. The product manager cares about the vision, its execution, the market reaction to the vision (even if an internal market), the health, care and feeding of the product, and the product’s eventual sunset or replacement. In the enterprise IT world, "third party" vendors (e.g. IBM) providing the back office systems had product management approaches, but these were external to the IT operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nor were IT-based product companies as numerous forty years ago as they are today; as noted above, the digital component of modern products continues to increase to the point where it&#8217;s often not clear whether a product is "IT" or not&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reacting to market feedback and adapting product direction is an essential role of the product owner. In the older model, feedback was often unwelcome, as the project manager typically was committed to the open-loop dead reckoning (see <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_special_section_systems_thinking_and_feedback">previous discussion</a>) of the project plan and changing scope or direction was seen as a failure, more often than not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, it’s accepted that systems evolve, perhaps in unexpected directions. Rapidly testing, learning, failing fast, and pivoting direction are all part of the lexicon, at least for market-facing IT-based products. And even back-office IT systems with better understood scope are being managed more as systems (or products) with lifecycles, as opposed to transient projects. (See the Amazon discussion, below.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what is product management and what does it mean for your team?</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_defining_product_management">Defining Product Management</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to define product management, we first need to define product. In Chapter 1, we established that products are goods, services, or some combination, with some feature that provides value for some consumer. BusinessDictionary.com <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/product.html">defines it thus</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
[A Product is] A good, idea, method, information, object or service created as a result of a process and serves a need or satisfies a want. It has a combination of tangible and intangible attributes (benefits, features, functions, uses) that a seller offers a buyer for purchase. For example a seller of a toothbrush not only offers the physical product but also the idea that the consumer will be improving the health of their teeth . . . A good or service [must] closely meet the requirements of a particular market and yield enough profit to justify its continued existence.
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; BusinessDictionary.com
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product <em>management</em>, according to the <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/product-management.html#ixzz3bHCVkoWj">same source</a>, is</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
The organizational structure within a business that manages the development, marketing and sale of a product or set of products throughout the product life cycle. It encompasses the broad set of activities required to get the product to market and to support it thereafter.
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; BusinessDictionary.com
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product management in the general sense often reports to the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). It represents the fundamental strategy of the firm, in terms of its value proposition and viability. The product needs to reflect the enterprise’s strategy for creating and maintaining customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product strategy for <strong>internally-facing</strong> products is likely not defined by the enterprise CMO. If it is a back-office product, then “business within a business” thinking may be appropriate. (Even the payroll system run by IT for HR is a “product,” in this view.) In such cases, there still is a need for someone to function as an "internal CMO" to the external "customers."</p>

As a field, product management has a professional association, the <a href="http://www.pdma.org">Product Development and Marketing Association</a>, which publishes an extensive and continuously-refined handbook, and supports local chapters, training and certification, and other activities typical of a mature professional organization.

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_defining_information_technology">As stated in chapter 1</a>, all kinds of industrial products have increasing amounts of “IT” in them. This means that an understanding of IT, and ready access to any needed IT specialty skills, is increasingly important to the general field of product management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of product design is focusing on the user, and what she or he needs. This is easier said than done. Entire books have been written on the various tools and techniques for doing this, from  focus groups to ethnographic analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product management includes research and development, which means that there is an element of uncertainty. This is of course also true of IT systems development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what does product management have to do with IT and software?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often, IT professionals resist drawing lessons from non-IT fields, because of a perception (only partially true) that these other fields (especially manufacturing) are “deterministic” while IT systems development is too “uncertain.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In reality, manufacturing is less deterministic than IT professionals often perceive, while software development is, at its most uncertain, just another form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_product_development">new product development</a>, and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development">research and development</a> and therefore can be managed on that basis.</p>

A holistic product-oriented approach contradicts a convenient over-simplification of IT delivery where everything is treated as a project. Such an approach is not Lean, in that treating all demand (coarse/strategic demand the same as fine-grained IT demand) amounts to batching, which creates inventory, waiting and potentially over-processing types of waste.

</table>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above distinctions are deliberately exaggerated and there are of course exceptions (short projects, processes that take years). However, it is in the friction between these perspectives we see some of the major problems in modern IT management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our scenario, you are now on a tight-knit, collaborative team. It is preferable that you think in terms of developing and sustaining a product. However, projects still exist, and sometimes you may find yourself on a team that is funded and operated on that basis. We will return to projects in Chapter 8.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_market_facing_supporting_back_office">Market facing, supporting, back office</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Chapter 1 we discussed the question of "who pays/who benefits" for the service, <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_defining_consumer_customer_and_sponsor">proposing that</a> the service consumer, the service customer, and the service sponsor might be three distinct roles (sometimes collapsing into 2 or 1 individual.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We see this again in how we can categorize the "customers" of IT services and systems. Roughly, such services can be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Directly market- and consumer-facing (e.g. Facebook), to be used by external consumers and paid for by either them or closely associated customers (e.g. Netflix, or an online banking system).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer "supporting" systems, such as the online system that a bank teller uses when interacting with a customer. Customers do not interact directly with such systems, but customer-facing representatives do, and problems with such systems may be readily apparent to the end customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completely "back-office" systems (HR, payroll, marketing, etc)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note however, that (especially in the current digitally transforming market) a service previously thought of as "back office" (when run internally) becomes "market-facing" when developed as a profit-seeking offering. For example, an HR system built internally is "back office," but Workday is a directly market-facing product, even though the two services may be similar in functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s all relative.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_productization_as_a_strategy_at_amazon">Productization as a strategy at Amazon</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Amazon (the online bookseller) is an important influence in the modern trend towards product-centric IT management. First, the founder Jeff Bezos mandated that all software development should be <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">service-oriented</a>, and assume that the functionality being built might at some point be offered to external customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, a widely reported practice at Amazon.com is the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3037542/productivity-hack-of-the-week-the-two-pizza-approach-to-productive-teamwork">limitation of product teams to between 5-7 people</a>, the number that can be fed by “two pizzas” (depending on how hungry they are).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are <a href="http://blog.idonethis.com/two-pizza-team/">good reasons</a> for this approach. It has long been recognized in software and IT management that larger teams do not necessarily result in higher productivity. The best known statement of this is Fred Brooks’ rule from The Mythical Man-Month, that “adding people to a late project will make it later.”<a href="#Brooks1975">[Brooks1975]</a></p>

Fred Brooks' <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, derived in part from his experiences leading the IBM OS-360 project, is one of the timeless classics in software engineering and IT management writing.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reasons for this have been extensively studied and analyzed <a href="#Madachy2008">[Madachy2008]</a> but in general it is due to the increased communication overhead of expanded teams. Product design work (of which software development is one form) is creative and highly dependent on tacit knowledge, interpersonal interactions, organizational culture, and other “soft” factors. Products, especially those with a significant IT component, can  be understood as socio-technical systems, often complex. This means that small changes to their components or interactions can have major effects on their overall behavior and value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This in turn means that newcomers to a product development organization can have a profound impact on the product. Getting them “up to speed” with the culture, mental models, and tacit assumptions of the existing team can be challenging and rarely is simple. And the bigger the team, the bigger the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The net result of these two practices at Amazon is the creation of multiple nimble services that are decoupled from each other, constructed and supported by teams appropriately sized for optimal high-value interactions.</p>

<h5 id="_features_vs_components">Features vs. components</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="2.04.02-features-v-components"></a>
As your product evolves, you may see an increasing differentiation of concerns, between features and components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Features are <strong>what</strong> your product <strong>does</strong>. They are what the customers perceive as valuable. “Scope as viewed by the customer” as <a href="#Kennaley2010">[Kennaley2010]</a> says (p. 169).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Components are <strong>how</strong> your product is <strong>built</strong>, such as database vs. Web components. In other words, they are a form of infrastructure (but infrastructure you may need to build yourself, rather than just spin up in the Cloud).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Feature teams are dedicated to a clearly defined functional scope, while component teams are defined by their technology platform. Component teams may become shared services, which need to be carefully understood and managed (more on this in Section 3).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may be easy to say that features are more important than components, but this can easily be carried too far. Do you want each feature team choosing its own database? Not recommended. Allowing feature teams to define their own technical direction can result in brittle, fragmented architectures, technical debt, and rework.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software product management needs to be a careful balance between these two perspectives. Some <a href="http://blog.octo.com/en/feature-team-beyond-the-buzzword/">recommend</a> a ratio of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum product owner is responsible for holding the product vision and seeing that the team executes the highest value work. To do this, the potential features for the product are maintained in a "backlog" that can be re-prioritized as necessary (rather than a large, fixed-scope project). The product owner also defines acceptance criteria for the backlog items.</p>

<p>One of the challenges with applying Lean to IT (as noted previously) is that many IT professionals (especially software developers) believe that manufacturing is a "deterministic" field, with any lessons from it inapplicable to developing technical products. "Creating software is like creating art, not being on an assembly line," is one line of argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The root cause of this debate is the distinction between product development and production. It is true that an industrial production line may be repetitive. But how did the production line come to be? It was created as part of a process of product development. <strong>That</strong> is not a repetitive process; it is a highly variable, creative process.</p>

Never confuse production with product development. The approaches, measures, and concerns are radically different. This book considers it an "original sin."

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One dead end that organizations keeps pursuing is the desire to make research and development (R&amp;D) more "predictable"; that is, to reduce variation and predictably create innovations. This never works well; game-changing innovations are usually complex responses to complex market systems dynamics, including customer psychology, current trends, and many other factors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In IT, simply developing software for a new problem (or even new software for an old problem) is an R&amp;D problem, not a production line problem. It is iterative, uncertain, and risky, just like other forms of product development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That does not mean it is completely un-manageable, or that its creation is a mysterious, artistic process. It is just a more variable process with a higher chance of failure, with a need to incorporate feedback quickly to reduce the risk of open-loop control failure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These ideas are well known to the Agile community and its authors. However, there is one thought leader who stands out in this field: an ex-Naval officer named Donald Reinertsen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many books on Agile development and management. Consider the following books, all well known and respected in the fields of software development and Agile:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reinertsen&#8217;s work dates back to 1991, and (orginally as a co-author with Preston G. Smith) presaged much of the Agile movement <a href="#Smith1991">[Smith1991]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reinertsen was partnering with David Anderson when Anderson created Kanban. He wrote the introduction to Leffingwell&#8217;s <em>Agile Software Requirements</em>, the initial statement of the Scaled Agile Framework. His influence is pervasive across the Agile community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>His work is deep and based on fundamental mathematical principles such as queueing theory (lightly touched on in <em>The Phoenix Project</em>). One way of reading his work is as a series of interdependent principles:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The flow, or throughput of product innovation is the primary determinant of financial success</p>

<li>
<p>Flow requires fast <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_a_brief_introduction_to_feedback">feedback</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feedback requires limiting work in process</p>

<li>
<p>Limiting work in process in product design contexts requires rigorous prioritization capabilities</p>

<li>
<p>Effective, economical prioritization requires understanding the <a href="http://www.leadingagile.com/2015/06/an-introduction-to-cost-of-delay/">cost of delay</a> for individual product features</p>

<p>Understanding cost of delay requires smaller batch sizes, consisting of cohesive features, not large projects.</p>

<p>After the Korean War, the US Air Force wished to clarify why its pilots had performed in a superior manner to the opposing pilots who were flying aircraft viewed as more capable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Boyd determined that humans go through a defined process in building their mental model of complex and dynamic situations. This has been formalized in the concept of the OODA loop. Standing for:</p>

"Work management" is an unusual title, deliberately chosen to reflect earlier stages of organizational growth. At this point, a fully realized process framework may not be needed, and the organization may not see a need to distinguish precisely between types of work processes.

As two more assistants were added, however, coordination problems did arise. One day, Miss Bisque tripped over a pail of glaze and broke five pots; another day, Ms. Raku opened the kiln to find that the hanging planters had all been glazed fuchsia by mistake. At this point, she realized that seven people in a small pottery studio could not coordinate all their work through the simple mechanism of informal communication.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;re now a team. You need to get work done. When your startup hired its first employees, and you went from two people to three or four, you almost certainly had to think about this. You are now getting feedback from both your users and product leadership calling for prioritization, the allocation of resources, and the tracking of effort and completion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People have different responsibilities and specialties, yet there is a common vision for delivering an IT-based product of some value. How do you keep track of the work? Mostly, you are in the same location, but people sometimes are offsite or keeping different hours. Beyond your product strategy, you have support calls increasingly coming in that result in fixes and new features, and it&#8217;s all getting complicated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You already have a product owner. You now institute Scrum practices of a managed backlog, daily standups and sprints. You also use Kanban-style task boards, which are essential for things like support-driven work, but the relationship of these to your Scrum practices is a matter of some ongoing debate. You don&#8217;t think you need full-blown project management&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;yet.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work management may start with verbal requests, emails, even postal mail. The design process may result in a wide variety of deliverables that also initiate work activity. And as your product matures, the product itself generates both routine and non-routine work. Some of the work depends on other work getting done. Sometimes you do not realize this immediately. All of this needs to be tracked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you ask your colleague to do one thing, and she doesn’t have anything else to do, it’s likely that the two of you will remember. If you ask her to do four things over a few days, you <strong>might</strong> both still remember. But if you are asking for new things every day, it is likely that some things will get missed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You each might start keeping your own “to do” list and this can handle a dozen or two dozen tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider an example of three people, each with their own to do list:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-todos.png" alt="2.05 todos">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this situation, each person has their own “mental model” of what needs to be done, and their own tracking mechanism. We don’t know how the work is being transmitted: emails, phone calls, hallway conversations (”Say Sara, there is an issue with Customer X’s bill, can you please look into it?”)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what happens when there are three of you? You ask coworker B to do something and in order to complete it she needs something from coworker C, whom you are also asking to complete tasks. As an organization scales, this can easily start to become like the children&#8217;s game of <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Play-the-Telephone-Game">“telephone”</a>:</p>

<p>At some point, you need to formalize your model of the work, how it is described, and how it flows. This is such a fundamental problem in human society that many different systems, tools, and processes have been developed over the centuries to address it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Probably the most important is the shared task reference point. What does this mean? The “task” is reified (see definition) into a common artifact.</p>
</div>

<p>For example, a “ticket” may be created. Or a “story.” At our current level of understanding, there is little difference between these concepts. The important thing they have in common is an independent existence. That is, Mary, Joe, and Sara might all change jobs, but the artifact persists independently of them. This can be called <em>reification</em>.</p>

<p>A complex IT-based system is not needed! (Nor for that matter a complex process framework, such as ITIL. This author sees little value in using such frameworks at this stage of evolution.)

<p>The rectangles labeled “Task” are index cards or sticky notes. The board itself might be a white board, or a cork bulletin board with push pins. It doesn’t really matter. The important thing is that, at a glance, the entire team can see its flow of work and who is doing what.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is usually called a “Kanban board” (from <a href="#Anderson2010">[Anderson2010]</a>), although Scrum originator Sutherland calls it a "Scrum board". The board at its most basic is not specific to either methodology. (See the sidebar on Scrum and Kanban.)</p>

<p>The basic board is widely used because it is a powerful artifact. Behind its deceptive simplicity is considerable industrial experience and relevant theory from operations management and human factors <a href="#Anderson2010">[Anderson2010]</a>.

<p>To understand Kanban it is advisable to discuss Lean briefly.</p>
</div>

<p>Kanban is a term originating from Lean and the Toyota Production System. Originally, it signified a “pull” technique in which materials would only be transferred to a given workstation on a definite signal that the workstation required the materials. This was in contrast to “push” approaches where work was allowed to accumulate on the shop floor, on the (now discredited) idea that it was more “efficient” to operate workstations at maximum capacity.</p>

There is a tremendous wealth of material available on Lean history and theory, and the IT student is urged to become familiar with it.<br>
<br>
Historically, there has been resistance in IT circles to learning lessons derived from manufacturing, due to misperceptions that manufacturing is too “repetitive” compared to IT systems development.<br>
<br>
 This resistance is disappearing with the new generation of thought leadership centered on Agile methods and related themes such as DevOps.

<p>David J. Anderson was a product manager at Microsoft who was seeking a more effective approach to managing software development. In consultation with Don Reinertsen (introduced in the <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_lean_lean_product_development_and_don_reinertsen">previous chapter</a>) he applied the original concept of Kanban to his development activities.<a href="#Anderson2010">[Anderson2010]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike Scrum, with its defined, high-pressure sprints, Kanban is a continuous process with no specified cadence. Work is “pulled” from backlog into active attention as resources are freed from previous work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is perhaps the most important aspect of Kanban - the idea that work is not accepted until there is capacity to perform it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may have a white board covered with sticky notes, but if they are stacked on top of each other with no concern for worker availability, you are not doing Kanban. You are accepting too much work in process and you are likely to encounter a "high-queue state" in which work becomes slower and slower to get done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are deeper philosophical and cultural tenets embedded in Kanban beyond workflow. Anderson and his colleagues continue to evolve Kanban into a more ambitious framework. Mike Burrows <a href="#Burrows2014">[Burrows2014]</a> identifies the following key principles</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start with what you do now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agree to pursue evolutionary change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initially, respect current processes, roles, responsibilities, and job titles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage acts of leadership at every level in your organization —from individual contributor to senior management.</p>

<p>Scrum has achieved widespread success and formalization, which is why Scrum training is widespread and generally consistent in content.</p>

<p>Processes cross functions.
Processes (e.g. Quote to Cash, Idea to Production) are what actually deliver value.
We need both process and function; we can’t organize solely around either.
Therefore, get used to matrix management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above statements are the management dogma I grew up with. Considered to be innovative at the time, originated by the likes of Michael Hammer and (more rigorously) Geary Rummler. (See Paul Harmon&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bptrends.com/publicationfiles/advisor20081209.pdf">excellent obituary of Geary Rummler</a>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But consider a day in the life in the modern corporation: dozens or hundreds of cross functional processes that have become a daily barrage of work on the people housed in the functional areas. Driven by back end automation, front ended by automated (or even manual) email notifications, these required activities include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>service requests,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compliance certifications,</p>

<li>

<li>
<p>expense reporting,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>travel approvals,</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and more - infinitely more. This is the modern, “process"-centric enterprise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>True, any one of these processes is (often) a relatively small burden to perform. Taken together, however, it’s the nightmare of <a href="http://www.waywordradio.org/adminisdribble_1/">Adminisdribble</a>: The daily death by a thousand cuts of required, cross-functional process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continual context switching. End to end flow in concept across functions, but little experienced by the multitasking individual. Invisible, unmanaged demand. A thousand channels for flow, but no throughput, because of gridlock.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What drives this? The combination of permanent downsizing, continually increasing governance &amp; compliance burdens, and the assumption that the enterprise can always tolerate another process. Overall organizational capacity is rarely considered, especially for “supporting" processes. And there is no appreciation for the emergent behavior when these myriads of processes interact in unexpected ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is why kanban is so radical. Within a limited scope, it is starting to challenge the IT management dogma at least. User stories, incidents, defects, service requests, changes… they are all “just work.” Just another sticky note on the board. Someone has to perform the work; someone has to allocate time and attention to it. A simple but utterly profound change in orientation. Kanban is the labor movement of the 21st century.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It seems to me that true “respect for people” (as advocated by Lean) of course must start with the recognition that work takes people’s time. I think the modern, process centric enterprise has lost sight of that reality. Is Kanban the answer?</p>

<h4 id="_the_shared_mental_model_of_the_work_to_be_done">The shared mental model of the work to be done</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As work flows through the system performing it, understanding its status is key to managing it.
One of the most important mechanisms for doing this is to simply define what is meant by “done.” The Agile Alliance <a href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/definition-of-done.html#sthash.6rSCZMyU.dpuf">states</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“The team agrees on, and displays prominently somewhere in the team room, a list of criteria which must be met before a product increment, often a user story, is considered "done". Failure to meet these criteria at the end of a sprint normally implies that the work should not be counted toward that sprint&#8217;s velocity.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This idea of defining “done” can be extended by the team to other concepts such as “blocked.” The important thing is that this is all part of the team’s shared mental model, and is best defined by the team and its customers. (However, governance and consistency concerns may arise if teams are too diverse in such definitions.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether you choose Scrum, Kanban, or choose not to label your work management at all, the important thing is that you are creating a shared mental model of the work: its envisioned form and content, and your progress towards it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another related concept from Lean is the idea of andon:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
Andon (Japanese: アンドン or あんどん or 行灯) is a manufacturing term referring to a system to notify management, maintenance, and other workers of a quality or process problem. The centrepiece is a signboard incorporating signal lights to indicate which workstation has the problem. The alert can be activated manually by a worker using a pullcord or button, or may be activated automatically by the production equipment itself. The system may include a means to stop production so the issue can be corrected. Some modern alert systems incorporate audio alarms, text, or other displays.
</blockquote>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Andon Cord is a well known concept in Lean Manufacturing. It originated with Toyota, where line workers were empowered to stop the production line if any defective materials or assemblies were encountered. Instead of attempting to work with the defective input, the entire line would shut down and all concerned would establish what had happened and how to prevent it. The concept of andon cord concisely summarizes the Lean philosophy of employee responsibility for quality at all levels. <a href="#Ohno1988">[Ohno1988]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
Stopping the machine when there is trouble forces awareness on everyone. When the problem is clearly understood, improvement is possible. Expanding this thought, we establish a rule that even in a manually operated production line, the workers themselves should push the stop button to halt production if any abnormality appears.

<p>This idea of a shared reference point, informing the shared mental model of the team, is essential.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is why a shared kanban board, with its dimensionality, is more informative than a simple to-do list (e.g.  in a spreadsheet). The cards occupy two dimensional space and are  moved over time to signify activity, both powerful cues to the human visual processing system.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why are shared visual representations important? Depending on how you measure, between 40% to as much as 80% of the human cortex is devoted to visual processing. Furthermore,  visual processing <a href="http://simplybrainy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2008-Int-Vis-Other-Senses-All-Illustrations.pdf">dominates mental activity</a>, consuming more neurons than the other four senses combined <a href="#Sells1957">[Sells1957]</a>. Visual representations are powerful communication mechanisms, well suited to our cognitive abilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is why Kanban boards located in the same room are so prevalent. They communicate and sustain the shared mental model of a human team. Similarly, monitoring tools for systems operation make use of various visual clues. Human visual orientation is also why Enterprise Architecture persists. People will always draw to communicate.

<h5 id="_time_and_space_shifting">Time and space shifting</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point your team will be faced with the problems of time and/or space shifting. People will be on different schedules, or in different locations, or both.
 There are two things we know about this. First, it leads to sub-optimal team communications and performance. Second, it is inevitable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The need for time and space shifting is one of the major drivers for more formalized IT systems. It is difficult to effectively use a physical Kanban board if people aren’t in the office. The outcome of the daily standup needs to be captured for the benefit of those who could not be there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, acceptance of time and space shifting may lead to more of it, even when it is not absolutely required. A constant pressure and questioning is recommended, given the superior bandwidth of face to face communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work management in practice has divided between development and operations toolsets. However, DevOps and Kanban are forcing a reconsideration and consolidation. Historically, here are some of the major tools and channels through which tasks and work are managed on both sides:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirements log</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue/risk/action item log</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defect tracker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agile backlogs (user stories)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service desk ticketing system</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kanban is a special case, as it can mean both a manual as well as an automated system. Obviously, for time and space shifting, we need an automated system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of these systems have common characteristics. All can (or should) be able to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Register a new task</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the work to be done (development or break/fix/remediate)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Represent the current status of the work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track who is currently accountable for it (individual and/or team)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicate the priority of the work, at least in terms of a simple categorization such as high/medium/low</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More advanced systems may also be able to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Link one unit of work to another (either as parent/child or peer to peer)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track the effort spent on the work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritize and order work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track the referral or escalation trail of the work, if it is routed to various parties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Link to communication channels such as conference bridges and paging systems</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first system you may find yourself acquiring along these lines is a help desk system.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_service_desk">The service desk</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a product starts to gain a user base, and as a company matures and grows, there emerges a need for human to human support. This is typically handled by a help desk or service desk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Service Desk (aka Help Desk), is the human face of IT when the IT systems are not meeting people&#8217;s expectations. We were first briefly introduced to the concept in our Service Lifecycle:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/images/1.01-ITStates.png" alt="1.01 ITStates">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The service desk is an interrupt-driven, task-oriented capability. It serves as a first point of contact for IT services that require some human support or intervention. As such its role can become broad, from provisioning access to assisting users in navigation &amp; usage, to serving as an alert channel for outage reporting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The service desk ideally answers each user&#8217;s request immediately, requiring no followup. If followup is required, a "ticket" is "issued."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a “help desk,” it may be focused on end user assistance and reporting Incidents.
As a “service desk,” it may expand its purview to accepting provisioning or other requests of various types (and referring and tracking those requests). Note that in some frameworks, Service Request and Incident are considered to be distinct processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term "ticket" dates to paper-based industrial processes, where the "help desk" might actually be a physical desk, where a user seeking services might be issued a paper ticket. Such "tickets" were also used in field services:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-ticket.jpg" alt="2.05 ticket">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In IT-centric domains, tickets are virtual; they are records in databases, not paper. The user is given a ticket "ID" or "number" for tracking (e.g., so they can inquire about the request&#8217;s status.) The ticket may be "routed" to someone to handle, but again in a virtual world what really happens is that the person it&#8217;s routed to is directed to look at the record in the database. (In paper based processes, the ticket might well be moved physically to various parties to perform the needed work.)</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Originally published at <a href="http://www.lean4it.com" class="bare">http://www.lean4it.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s talk mental models. The biggest one we have in IT.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the broad system of IT management, we often hear of three stages, “Plan/Build/Run.” We make plans for a new IT system, we construct it, and we run it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT organizations often structure themselves and communicate to a large degree along these lines. I’ve used them myself in any number of writings. However, I have come to question the usefulness of “Plan-Build-Run” (which I’ll abbreviate PBR) as a mental model for understanding and guiding IT management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While it pervades IT management thinking, and can clearly be seen in the structures of frameworks like ITIL and COBIT, PBR is ill suited for the demands of 21st century IT management. I believe it is fundamentally a statement of waterfall thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-PBR1.jpg" alt="2.05 PBR1">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The major structures of Plan, Build, Run in my experience are framed as discrete, mutually exclusive states, with interfaces (information exchanges and control signalling) in between them. The model reflects IT&#8217;s history of project-centric management, in which large batches of work are moved across those three phases. Since each large batch is fragile and the state transitions are risky and high ceremony, there is also concern for insulating each batch from outside "interference."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This results in systems being built in isolation from one another and without openness to feedback from later stages or other batches of work. Thus we also lose opportunities to learn from mistakes, leverage shared services and ensure architectural consistency across the IT estate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continuous improvement cannot be an afterthought. Yet when PBR is the fundamental model, continuous improvement activities are run as spreadsheet-driven initiatives, poorly resourced and in constant contention with the "real" work of Plan, Build, Run. (The classic example is the massive spreadsheet of Audit findings which becomes a political football in The Phoenix Project. Note that I advocate for a broad definition of continuous improvement.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;d suggest these kinds of approaches are essentially "inspecting quality in" and therefore not what Deming would have wanted. ("We cannot rely on mass inspection to improve quality.")</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, is PBR the reflection of your organization&#8217;s communication structures? Conway&#8217;s Law would suggest that PBR is the reflection of embedded organizational communications structures - dating I would argue from the time of Frederick Taylor and the worst excesses of hierarchical, command and control management philosophy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is probably the most pernicious consequence - specialists in planning, building, and running, all trying to optimize their worlds, with the "planners" at the top, the "builders" in the middle and the "runners" taking orders at the bottom. The trouble is that this idealized hierarchical model is utterly ineffective.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It certainly doesn&#8217;t reflect military principles, often caricatured as "command and control" (see Reinertsen&#8217;s discussion of military doctrine on decentralized control in Principles of Product Development Flow). Effective product and software development has also long eschewed it; much evidence demonstrates the futility of relying on "expert" opinion and planning in truly complex domains. (See this excellent discussion from a venture capitalist at Y-Combinator.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Concepts like Lean Startup experimentation, generalizing specialists, and empowered 2-pizza product teams do not seem to reflect a PBR model. In an Agile world, the work boundaries blur across these phases. Those who plan, also build and run, and the primary planning of worth is planning the next experiment for testing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some will say this is unfair. One hears various responses:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Iterate (with increasing speed), either the whole cycle or subsets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insert feedback loops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See the stages as overlapping</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-PBR2.jpg" alt="2.05 PBR2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My question is, even with these enhancements, is this mental model the best foundation?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the "fast PBR" response a bit more. Agile and Lean Startup arguably would call for many cycles of PBR, with each cycle constituting a test, or a story, or some other small grained delivery. Increasing the speed of this cycle is a widespread theme in discussions of Agile, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, and the rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now if you are going to "spin it faster," a circular illustration would seem more appropriate:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-PBR3.png" alt="2.05 PBR3">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what happens when we spin this fast? Remember your elementary physics of color? It all blends together, just as we see boundaries blurring today between Dev and Ops:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-PBR4.png" alt="2.05 PBR4">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when the phases blur, what emerges? That&#8217;s the question&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, I should say&#8230;&#8203; IF YOU ARE LUCKY it all blends together. This assumes that you have somehow overcome the transactional overhead with those state transitions, information exchanges, and organizational handoffs, as you attempt to speed them up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What if a given state change isn&#8217;t needed for a particular cycle? You wind up fighting a system hard-wired to protect the role of each activity (and all their sub-activities). You wind up asking to "tailor" methodologies, to exempt your work from activities that are clearly non-value-add, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accelerating PBR isn&#8217;t sufficient; it is still a sequential process with discrete steps and implications of information and control flow between each, reinforcing a dysfunctional division of organizational responsibilities. Can you get up to speed if people are trying to "optimize" the "plan," "build," or "run" phase independently? How can you optimize one third of a wheel?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I ask: is PBR how work really gets done? How value gets delivered? If it is how work gets done in your organization, how effective is it? If you are fortunate to be working in an organization using Agile approaches, can you in truth characterize them as simply "fast PBR"? Does this mental model fundamentally inform your daily experience?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think "spin it faster" is an insufficient response. A continuous flow is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the delivery cycle accelerates and the boundaries begin to break down between Plan/Build/Run, what emerges? First, one starts to see that work has common characteristics across Plan, Build, and Run.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We might observe that a common workflow or kanban system can be utilized across planning, building, and running activities. We might also notice that smaller teams require people to cover more responsibilities ("generalizing specialists"), especially when the boundaries between planning, building, and running are blurring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We see that distinctions between "incidents," "problems," and "user stories" become increasingly arbitrary when it is the same team that needs to respond to any. Certainly, there are differences between proactive and reactive work, but as forms of demand both compete for the same supply of resources, and when tracked in different systems cause overburden, uncoordinated effort, and bad multi-tasking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also see that continuous improvement activities (which are kind of a middle ground between proactive and reactive) are "just more demand" and also compete for resources with purely proactive and reactive demand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we consider all this, the question arises: What, in fact, <strong>is</strong> the IT work, in the general case? The irrevocable meeting of demand with supply, with intent to generate value. Same in IT as in the rest of industry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are not novel concepts. Supply and demand stem from fundamental economics and operational management. I also want to add Execution, which is a widely accepted industrial term that covers the ideally optimal translation of supply and demand into value, via detailed resource and capacity management, dispatching, process monitoring, and performance analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an aside:  I am not in favor of naive approaches to equating IT delivery with manufacturing. But, as Eric says in The Phoenix Project,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“You think IT Operations is rocket-science compared to manufacturing. What absolute baloney&#8230;&#8203;From where I’m sitting, the people in this [manufacturing facility] have been far more creative and courageous than anything I’ve seen come from you IT guys so far.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Demand management starts from the premise that regardless of the size of the implied work, all demand on IT resources should be understood in a unified manner (as popularized in the Phoenix Project). From a new mobile device to the day’s incident reports and change requests, to a strategic initiative implying a $10 million projects, it’s all “just demand.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Different techniques come into play depending on planning horizon, value, scope, risk, and other parameters - more on this to come. Some demand signals contain others, or have complex interdependencies - e.g. an Incident that generates a Change, or a Project that contains multiple Service Requests. But if we understand demand as a unified entity we position ourselves to provide much better service to our stakeholders while at the same time giving our IT staff a saner existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Supply represents the fundamentals of “atoms, bits, and cells”: hardware, software, and people, under various ownership and sourcing models (e.g. Cloud). The CIO is responsible for increasingly complex IT sourcing and contract management strategies, and understanding one’s baseline supply is key to evaluating new supplier options for technology products and people with the skills to exploit them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, next generation IT execution management starts with demand and supply generally, and looks for optimal (or at least satisfactory) means of delivering value. “Projects” and “tickets” are seen as part of a unified management structure, not as the respective domains of "builders" and "runners." The availability of resources is always considered before releasing work, and ongoing scenario-based forecasting is employed to identify emergent constraints. And time tracking is completely transparent, relying on intelligent automation to determine what people have actually been working on. No Friday afternoon time reconstruction!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, Demand - Supply - Execution. Here is a graphical representation emphasizing the continuous nature of this mental model:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-PBR6.jpg" alt="2.05 PBR6">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well established IT process areas such as project, release, incident, change, and so forth are important and will continue, but I think a DSE approach could counteract the tendency to form functional silos around each&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or around a particular PBR cycle and its inputs and outputs&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and instead promote a whole-systems approach to IT management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To summarize Keynes, “even the most practical man of affairs is usually in the thrall of the ideas of some long-dead economist.” Basic conceptual structures like plan/build/run and demand/supply/execute have consequences. When widely adopted to the point where they are just “common sense,” they define our social relationships, operational thinking, problem solving, and more. And thus, while we may think that “plan/build/run” is some form of IT natural law, it is a human construct that can be adapted or even discarded if we no longer find it useful. I think it&#8217;s time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, here is my first graphical representation of the Demand/Supply/Execute model for IT service organizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-DSE.gif" alt="2.05 DSE">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The intent of this model is to provide an alternative to Plan/Build/Run and its sequential, waterfall, and Taylorist connotations. It is also intended to support modern Agile methods and philosophy which emphasize iteration, fast feedback, flow, and especially (per Don Reinertsen) managing queues, limiting Work in Progress and supporting small batch sizes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bottom to top, this diagram tells a story of demand and supply as they progress through increasingly refined understandings to the very specific execution of work and delivery of value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have markets and regulations, which define and constrain the potential demand for an IT-centric product. Markets are met with strategies and product offerings, which lead to programs of work, projects, and platform decisions. These in turn lead to identifying user stories, writing software, configuring platforms, and executing changes, service requests and work tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is NOT a methodology. These constructs can be as light or heavyweight as needed and value scenarios can originate at any point; there is no contradiction with Lean Startup and Agile principles of architectural iterations and minimum viable products. The existence of "Project" as a concept in the model does not mean that all work happens via Projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That finer and finer grained demand stream parallels a finer and finer grained supply stream. Large blocks of capital are translated into strategic technology choices and vendor relationships and investments in skilled people. More detailed budgets and planning culminate ultimately in the availability of people, hardware, and software for given assignments, e.g, an empty slot on a Kanban board.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, the journey can start anywhere, with a large block of traditionally managed programmatic capital or a small round of seed funding translated directly into a two-pizza team with maximum autonomy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately the deployed IT service system is available for fulfilling transactional service demand which can be measured in terms of quality, availability and performance. When demand and supply irrevocably combine, that is my definition of execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had a number of requirements driving this model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, it needed to be a graphical representation that could not be read as a sequence. That is the flaw of any model which is too easily reduced to a linear format, such as Plan/Build/Run. Circular models are a popular alternative, but repeating a sequence is not enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My primary reservation about value networks is their lack of a goal. What is to be done? How do I develop an action plan without some sense of the network’s purpose? (More here.) But the value network critique of naive sequencing is right on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the names “Plan/Build/Run” and “Demand/Supply/Execute” are similar in format, they are very different structurally. It is not usually possible to fully inventory demand and only THEN turn to considerations of supply. Forecasting is inherent in the relationship between the two, which both must operate continuously and simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, if we are trying to shift the IT mental mental models from sequential to network my proposal is that we start with the simplest non-sequential, non-linear concept, a vertex, two simultaneous vectors converging on a point.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-DSE2.jpg" alt="2.05 DSE2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the inverted “V” approximates human legs, it reinforces the feeling of simultaneous action. Both legs must exert effort simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The gap between the legs of the V is filled with the "Fog of Forecasting."</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-DSE3.gif" alt="2.05 DSE3">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the lower level, larger grained abstractions it is more difficult to understand demand and supply, especially when product development (e.g. novel software engineering) is involved. As demand and supply converge to the point of execution, a finer and finer grained awareness is created of the impending work and whether it is likely to be successful - that is, if demand will effectively and efficiently be paired with supply. (Notice how the fog lifts as you get closer to actual execution.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We only start to really get a feel for how execution is going to work when we get down to team and individual level assignments across all queues and ultimately actual Kanban slots or their equivalent (e.g. assigned and accepted work orders).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Turning to the choices of terms - the words inhabiting each leg (Asset, Release, Strategy, Team, etc):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the nouns are things that may be found in various IT management systems (Incidents, Assets, etc), or at least deliverables &amp; leadership conversations (Strategies, Programs). Roughly speaking, they go from larger grained and more abstract at the bottom, to smaller grained and more specific at the top.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) is included – one thing I appreciated about the Phoenix Project is that GRC is seen itself as a form of demand. Laws, regulations, and risks translate into policies, controls, and ultimately audit findings to be remediated, and all of this is also demand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted above, there is still a risk that each leg will receive too sequential a reading. A value scenario can start anywhere. There is NO methodology proposed or assumed.  As  elsewhere, the framework simply represents frequently used IT terms, including some of my explorations of service semantics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This picture is not overly concerned with functional boundaries (legal and/or internal). These can appear in many ways. The primary boundary is between the service act vertex (inside-out) and the service outcome vertex (outside-in). But additional org boundaries might be found between demand side and supply side functions (IT Demand Management vs. Asset Management), and/or between different abstraction levels (Project Management vs. Incident Management).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, this is an IT-centric representation. The framwork might be more broadly applicable to other domains, but I will leave that to others for now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In closing: I think this mental model is a more accurate reflection of IT practice as it is evolving. It avoids sequential, linear and waterfall thinking as well as command and control Taylorism. It accomodates well known ITSM functional concepts, but aligned along a different fundamental structure, a structure better aligned with economic principles.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In search of the PMDB and PIs</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I was preparing chicken piccata last night, I had one of those flashes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the IT industry, why don&#8217;t we care about process information the same way we care about configuration information?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve had a 15-year conversation about CMDBs. It&#8217;s a well known idea that all configuration data should be put in a repository, or short of that, should be seen as part of an federated system. Applications, servers, databases, files, queues, executables, services, racks, switches, etc, etc, etc should all be seen as Configuration Items, or "CIs."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But, if you ask ITSM advocates about processes, they will talk specifically about Incidents, Problems, Changes, Releases, etc as if they all are fundamentally different.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think we need the concept of a Process Item - just as a specific Server and an Application can both be CIs, so can a specific Incident and a Change both be PIs. They could inhabit the same PMDB, or be federated in a common PMS. [Yes, I recognize the unfortunate acronym :-) Let&#8217;s figure out better naming later.]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This in fact is how many actual implementations of IT management tools work. But at a framework level, it is NOT how people are educated in IT management - the education and mental model continues to be that Incidents, Changes and Problems are very distinct and at best cross-reference each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the world of Process, we have a series of related terms that indicate a</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"potentially recurring series of events with various complexity (parallelism, sequentially related or not, and so on)"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>as the Oracle Communications Model states. Under this general heading we have:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Program</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service Request</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incident</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Problem (and other Improvement Opportunity)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But (as I have pointed out elsewhere) the way these are currently implemented is too often as distinct queues of work with no coordination and understanding of aggregate demand. There is no awareness or concern when people who are critical to a Project also wind up handling high criticality Incidents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think there is much justification for promoting the ideas of Process Item and a unified PMDB as  industry guidance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, it aligns well with the growing interest in Kanban and limiting work in process. All these Process types compete for resources. If all are seen as fundamentally similar then it is possible to understand the aggregate demand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My coverage as an analyst of the Professional Services Automation tool sector (e.g. Tigerpaw) suggests that this class of tooling is already moving in this direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are complex dependencies between PIs just as with CIs - larger grained PIs such as Project may contain any number of smaller grained PI types such as Release, Change, and Request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above-mentioned Oracle Communications Model (which is now conformant with eTOM) requires that the PROCESS entity be used as the overarching parent for all process activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During one large program I was part of, all Releases, Project milesones, and Changes were consolidated into a single timeline view which was praised by senior executives as one of the best orienting mechanisms they had seen.
I have seen various attempts and interest along these lines, but always company or vendor specific. I wonder if the lack of a PI/PMDB concept in fact may be why the concept of CMDB has had such struggles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People have often said to me, "Isn&#8217;t the CMDB the basis of ERP for IT"?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My view is no, no more than the Bill of Materials is the basis for manufacturing ERP. The core of ERP systems is more about process and execution, and that is what we are missing in large scale IT management. We&#8217;ve spent years struggling with the data-centric orientation the CMDB discussion gave us, while shortchanging the process and execution side of the work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I realize the red flags that come up with any suggestion of a centralized system, which is why I am more in favor of seeing the PI concept as a logical interface. If all Process Items had some degree of overarching consistency, they could be exchanged and federated as part of execution activities, without requiring a monolithic centralized data store.</p>

<p>As your product gains more use, you find that running it inevitably becomes a distinct concern from building it. For all their logic, computers are still surprisingly unreliable. Servers running well tested software that remain "up" for weeks all of a sudden hang and have to be rebooted. Sometimes it&#8217;s clear why (for example, a log filled up that no-one expected) and in other cases there just is no explanation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Engineering and operating complex IT-based distributed systems is a significant engineering challenge. Even with infrastructure as code, it is distinct from software development per se. Questions of scalability, performance, caching, load balancing, and so forth usually become apparent first through feedback from the operations team.</p>

<p>What do we mean by operations? Operations management is a broad topic in management theory, with whole programs dedicated to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We started to run into this in chapter 5, as we examined the topic of “work management” - in traditional operations management, the question of work is primary. However, in IT, “operations” tends to have a more technical meaning, being focused on the immediate questions of systems integrity, availability and performance, and feedback from the user community (i.e., the service or help desk).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Operations often can mean, “everything but development” in an IT context. When merged with Development into “DevOps,” one gets IT Product Management with an Agile twist.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock important">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider the following various definitions of “operations” in an IT context. Some are relevant to our “two pizza team” scenario, some might be more applicable to larger environments:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keeping track of an IT product’s availability (is the Web site working?), and troubleshooting if it goes down (e.g. by rebooting it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Answering phone calls from users requiring support. They may be calling because a system or service they need is malfunctioning. They may also be calling because they do not understand how to use the system for the value experience they have been led to expect from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physically traveling to a remote site to evaluate and if necessary update or fix IT hardware and/or software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performing routine work, such as installing hardware, granting access, or running or testing backups. Such routine work may be scheduled, or it may be on request (e.g. ticketed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring security protocols are followed, e.g. access controls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As above, the primary thing that operations does NOT do is develop new systems functionality. However, new functionality usually has operational impacts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In manufacturing and other traditional industries, product development was a minority of work, while operations was where the bulk of work happened. However, when an operational task involving information becomes repetitive and risk-free, it can be automated with a computer. This continuous cycle of innovation and commoditization has driven closer and closer ties between “development” and “operations.” It also has driven confusion around exactly what is meant by “operations.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In many organizations, there is an “Infrastructure and Operations” function. Pay close attention to the naming. A matrix may help, because we have two dimensions to consider here.</p>

“Don’t mess with that server! It’s … Production!!!”
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; unknown
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Production” is a term that new IT recruits rapidly learn has forbidding connotations. To be “in production” means that the broader enterprise value stream is directly dependent on that asset. Breakage or mishandling will result in questions and concerns from powerful forces. Be Very Scared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do things get to be “in production”? What do we mean by that?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, let’s get back to our fundamental principle that there is an IT system delivering some "moment of truth" to someone. This system can be of any scale, but fundamentally we are able to conceive of it having a “state.” (See http::/url[State, Configuration, and Discovery].)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we want to change the behavior of this system, we are cautious. We reproduce the system at varying levels of fidelity and experiment with potential changes. This is called development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we start to gain confidence in our experiments, we increase the fidelity and also start to communicate more widely that we are contemplating a change to the state of the system. We may increase the fidelity along a set of traditional names: </p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Development</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Integration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance Testing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final state, where value is realized, is “Production.”</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.06-environments.png" alt="2.06 environments">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is nothing sacred about the environments listed above. You will see many variations, especially at scale.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea that one sequentially moves (”promotes”) new system functionality through a series of states to gain confidence before finally changing the state of the production system is historically well established. However, the production state is notoriously difficult to reproduce fully, especially in highly distributed environments. While infrastructure as code has simplified the problem, lower environments simply can&#8217;t match production completely in all its complexity, especially interfaced interactions with other systems or when large, expensive pools of capacity are involved.. Therefore there is always risk in changing the state of the production system. Mitigating strategies include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extensive automated test harnesses that can quickly determine if system behavior has been unfavorably altered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elaborating lower environments with strategies such as service virtualization to make them appear more like production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardening services against their own failure in production, or the failure of services on which they depend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the size (and therefore complexity and risk) of changes to production (a key DevOps strategy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that changes to the production system can be easily and automatically reversed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using policy-aware infrastructure management tools</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another important development in environmental approaches is A/B testing. In this approach, the “production” environment is segregated into two or more discrete states, with different features or behaviors exposed to users in order to assess their reactions (see sidebar).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_do_we_need_environments_at_all">Do we need environments at all?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The author has heard it recommended that the term “environment” be eliminated, as it tends to result in turf wars and empire building, and potentially the waste of fixed assets (see chapter 8). Performance environments are particularly in question.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, in a dynamic infrastructure environment (private or public), one simply defines the kind of test one wants to perform and provisions that capacity on-demand.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Testing in Production?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It used to be that the concept of “testing in production” was frowned upon. Now, with these mitigating strategies, and the recognition that complex systems cannot ever be fully reproduced, there is more tolerance for the idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But with older systems that may lack automated testing, incremental deployment, or easy rollback, it is strongly recommended to retain existing promotion strategies, as these are battle-tested and known to reduce risk. Often, their cycle time can be decreased.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__development_is_production">“Development is production”</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the flip side, development systems must never be treated casually.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The development pipeline itself (Chapter 3, figure X) represents a significant operational commitment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure of a source code repository, if not backed up, could wipe out a company (see the Code Spaces sidebar in Chapter 2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure of a build server or package repository could be almost as bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the digital economy, dozens or hundreds of developers out of work represents a severe operational and financial setback, even if the nominal “production” systems continue to function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s therefore important to treat “development” platforms with the same care as production systems. This requires nuanced approaches: with infrastructure as code, particular virtual machines or containers may represent experiments, expected to fail often and be quickly rebuilt. No need for burdensome change processes when VM base images and containers are being set up and torn down hundreds of times each day!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the platforms supporting the instantiation and teardown of those VMs are production platforms, supporting the business of new systems development.</p>

<p>But how does one “observe” computing infrastructure? Clearly, sitting in the data center (assuming you could get in) and looking at the faceplates of servers will not convey much useful information. Monitoring tools are the software that watches the software (and systems more broadly).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A variety of techniques are used to monitor computing infrastructure. Typically these involve communication over a network with the device being managed. Often, the network traffic is over the same network carrying the primary traffic of the computers. Sometimes, however, there is a distinct "out of band" network for management traffic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A classic, simple monitoring tool will simply observe a computing node, perhaps by “pinging” it periodically, and will raise an alert if the node does not respond within an expected time frame. If you are working through this course&#8217;s labs, you will see an example of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More broadly, these tools provide a variety of mechanisms for monitoring and controlling operational IT systems, often through small software “agents” deployed to computing platforms. These agents may monitor processes and their return codes, performance metrics (e.g. memory and CPU utilization), events raised through various channels, network availability, log file contents (e.g. with standing filters for messages indicating problems), interactions with other elements in the IT infrastructure, and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some monitoring covers low level system indicators not usually of direct interest to the end user. Other monitoring may attempt to synthetically re-create the user&#8217;s "moment of truth." Web application response time monitoring, in which synthetic transactions are run as proxies for end user experience, is an example of this. See <a href="#Limoncelli2014">[Limoncelli2014]</a>, chapters 16-17.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of this data may then be forwarded to a central console and be integrated, with the objective of supporting the organization’s service level agreements in priority order.
Enterprise monitoring tools are notorious for requiring agents (small, continuously-running programs) on servers; while some things can be detected without such agents, having software running on a given computer still provides the richest data. Since licensing is often agent-based, this gets expensive.</p>

<h5 id="_aggregation_and_operations_centers">Aggregation and operations centers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is not possible for a Level-1 24 x 7 operations team to access and understand the myriads of element managers and specialized monitoring tools present in the large IT environment. Instead, these teams rely on aggregators of various kinds to provide an integrated view into the complexity. These aggregators may focus on raw status events, or specifically on performance aspects related either to the elements or to logical transactions flowing across them. They may incorporate dependencies from configuration management to provide a true “business view” into the event streams. This is directly analogous to the concept of andon board from Lean practices, or the idea of “information radiator” from Agile principles (<strong>*</strong> cite AA).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A monitoring console may present a rich set of information to an operator. Too rich, in fact, as systems become large. For this reason, monitoring tools are often linked directly to ticketing systems; on certain conditions, a ticket is created and assigned to a team or individual.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enabling a monitoring console to auto-create tickets however, needs to be carefully considered and designed. A notorious scenario is the “ticket storm,” where a monitoring system creates multiple (perhaps thousands) of tickets, all essentially in response to the same condition. Event de-duplication starts to become an essential capability, which leads to distinguishing the monitoring system from the event management system.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_understanding_business_impact">Understanding business impact</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the intersection of event aggregation and operations centers is the need to understand business impact. It is not, for example, always obvious what a server is being used for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may be surprising to new students, and perhaps those with experience in smaller organizations. However, in many large “traditional” IT environments, where the operations team is distant from the development organization, it is not necessarily easy to determine what a given hardware or software resource is doing or why it is there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clearly, this is unacceptable in terms of security, value management, and any number of other concerns. However, from the start of distributed computing, the question “what is on that server?” has been all too frequent in large IT shops.</p>

<blockquote>
In computer science and automata theory, the state of a digital logic circuit or computer program is a technical term for all the stored information, at a given instant in time, to which the circuit or program has access.[1] The output of a digital circuit or computer program at any time is completely determined by its current inputs and its state.

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In all of IT (whether “infrastructure” or “applications” there is a particular concern with managing state. IT systems are remarkably fragile. One incorrect bit of information - a “0” instead of a “1” - can completely alter a system’s behavior, to the detriment of business operations depending on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, any development of information technology - starting with the initial definition of the computing platform - depends on robust management of state.
￼
The following are examples of state:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The name of a particular server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network address of that server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The software installed on that server, in terms of the exact version and bits that comprise it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>State also has more transient connotations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The current processes listed in the process table</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The memory allocated to each process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current users logged into the system</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we saw in the previous section some server/application/business mappings. These are also a form of state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is therefore not possible to make blanket statements like “we need to manage state.” Computing devices go through myriads of state changes with every cycle of their internal clock. (Analog and quantum computing are out of scope for this book.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary question in managing state is “what matters”? What aspects of the system need to persist, in a reliable and reproducible manner?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of OODA, determining and tracking the state of a system under investigation is one of the fundamental tools. With current practices, for example, this might mean examining the configuration management/provisioning system to determine how the basic operating system was built.</p>

<p>Closely related to monitoring is the concept of discovery. While monitoring focuses on the activity of a given system, discovery is focused on state.

<p>The classic example of significant capacity utilization is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)">Black Friday/Cyber Monday</a> experience of retailers. Both physical store and online ecommerce systems are placed under great strain annually around this time, with the year&#8217;s profits potentially on the line.</p>

<h5 id="_performance_management">Performance management</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Performance management focuses on the responsiveness (e.g. speed) of the systems being used. Responsiveness may be related to capacity utilization, but some capacity issues don&#8217;t immediately affect responsiveness. For example, a disk drive may be approaching full. When it fills, the system will immediately crash, and performance is severely affected. But until then, the system performs fine. The disk needs to be replaced on the basis of capacity reporting, not performance trending. On the other hand, some performance issues are not related to capacity. A mis-configured router might badly affect a web site&#8217;s performance, but the configuration simply needs to be fixed - there is no need to handle as a capacity-related issue.</p>

<p>Capacity analytics at its most advanced is a true Big Data problem domain. At a simpler level, it may consist of monitoring CPU, memory, and storage utilization across a given set of nodes, and raising alerts if certain threshholds are approached.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we considered the basic elements necessary for a collaborative product team, achieving success but still at a manageable human scale.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our IT-centric team needed capabilities for evolving its product, managing its work, and operating its product. In some cases, time and space shifting might drive the team to automating basic capabilities such as work management and ticketing. The overall assumption however was that for the most part, people are co-located and still can communicate with minimal friction.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are now a "team of teams," at a size where face to face communication is increasingly supplemented by other forms of communication and coordination. You are seeing more and more specialization in your organization, with the tendency of functional specialists to identify more with their field than with the needs of your customers and your business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your teams are all good, and get results, but in different ways. You need some level of coordination and not everyone can talk to everyone; people are no longer co-located and there may be different schedules involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You now have multiple products. Some may be external, some may be internal, but they are starting to develop complex interdependencies. Tensions between various teams are starting to emerge. There is an increasing desire among your stakeholders and executives for control and predictability. You are considering various frameworks for managing your organization. This is where it gets hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are no shortage of contractors and consultants all advocating various flavors of process and project management, some advocating older approaches and "frameworks" and others proposing newer Agile &amp; Lean perspectives. The very concepts of process and project management are occasionally called into question by both your employees and various "thought leaders," and it&#8217;s all very confusing.</p>

<h3 id="_section_iii_introduction">Section III introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scenario:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 7: Culture and Organization</strong>
 We&#8217;re getting big.  How are we formally structured? How are people grouped, and to whom do they report, with what kind of expectations? Why this way and not that? Who are we? What are the unspoken assumptions that underly our daily work?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 8: Project and Resource Management</strong>
We want to get bigger stuff done. Some argue that we don&#8217;t need projects at all any more, and it&#8217;s true that more and more we think in terms of <strong>products</strong> where we used to think of <strong>projects</strong>. But there still is a need to orchestrate the work; even Google and Facebook use project managers. We also have to understand what people are doing on a daily basis. Do we have the right people doing the the work? How can we find the best people to grow our initiative? We also remain concerned that work continues to flow well, that we don&#8217;t take on too much work in process, and that people are not overloaded and multi-tasking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 9: Process Management</strong>
OK, we have a structure.  Work needs to flow across the structure, and the projects and products need certain resources and services delivered predictably. Our increasingly specialized organization needs some specialization of processes, and without some kind of coordination  we run the risk of two teams trying to change the same thing at the same time.  We also become specifically concerned with the process by which process is managed, i.e., continuous improvement.</p>

Roughly speaking those who work in connection with the [Automated Computing Engine] will be divided into its masters and its servants. Its masters will plan out instruction tables for it, thinking up deeper and deeper ways of using it. Its servants will feed it with cards as it calls for them. They will put right any parts that go wrong. They will assemble data that it requires. In fact the servants will take the place of limbs&#8230;&#8203;<br>
<br>
As time goes on the calculator itself will take over the functions both of masters and of servants. The servants will be replaced by mechanical and electrical limbs and sense organs… The masters are liable to get replaced because as soon as any technique becomes at all stereotyped it becomes possible to devise a set of instruction tables which will enable the electronic computer to do it for itself…”

<p>You are going through a critical juncture, the "team of teams" transition. You have increasingly specialized people delivering an increasingly complex product, or perhaps even several distinct products. You are in constant discussions around the tension between functional depth versus cross functional delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many of your employees and consultants emphasize the role of culture, but what do they mean? Is there such a thing as a "good" culture? How is one culture better than another? How can you retain that startup feel you had previously, when things are getting this big?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You often think about how your company should be structured. There is no shortage of opinions there either. From functional centers of excellence to cross-functional product teams, and from strictly hierarchical models to radical models like holacracy, there seems to be an infinite variety of choices.</p>

<blockquote>
 In the early stages, you have to hire generalists who are both willing and able to take on dozens of tasks at once. Your developers will have to speak with potential customers; your accountants will have to give advice on product direction; and the born salesman on your team will need to put the phone down a few hours a day and set up a new employee’s computer. This is the exciting, four-people-and-an-idea stage popularly associated with startups— but it doesn’t last very long.<br>
 <br>
  For a lot of your employees, growing out of this phase will be a welcome development: programmers don’t want to be in accounting meetings, and salespeople don’t want to sit in a dark, quiet room with the engineers. People have talents and skills they want to develop, and a healthy degree of specialization allows them to do that.

<p>So, you are getting bigger now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even as a cohesive, single team you had increasing complexity of support services. You needed legal and accounting advice to get the startup going. When you started hiring people, you needed HR and payroll, and at some point you need an internal person whose daily job is money (they’ll become the CFO someday).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also are buying stuff and paying bills, and you’ve got sales people and marketing people and you need to support your customers and collect money they have promised to pay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How are you going to organize? More importantly, how are you going to think about organizing? This is a hard question. It’s important to get organization right, and the question never goes away. There is a lot of theory, history, and advice available on to how to organize your company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not a general business school textbook, or even  a textbook on startups and entrepreneurship. However, in the current environment, it is essential for technologists, no matter how specialized, to understand the general context they are operating in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In one chapter, we cannot cover much, but there’s an increasing consensus that the choice of organizational form has a fundamental impact on the success of IT-based product delivery. So we’re going to devote a chapter to this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In keeping with our <a href="#0.01-emergence">evolutionary approach</a>, let’s assume you’ve been fairly ad-hoc in your organizational structure up to now, doing your best to avoid specialization. Perhaps you’ve even been working as a collective. Nevertheless, you’ve needed a variety of skills to get this far in your journey: you are certainly not all Java programmers!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps the first question you need to ask is to what extent you wish to centralize IT. This is a significant one. The current trend is towards decentralizing IT, but there are good reasons to maintain IT as a separate organizational entity. Sriram Narayan, in his book <em>Agile Organization Design</em> (<a href="#Narayam2015">[Narayam2015]</a>), points out that "IT work is labor-intensive and highly specialized," and therefore sourcing IT talent is a particular organizational capability it may not make sense to distribute. Furthermore, IT work is performed on medium to long time scales, and that "IT culture" differs from "business culture."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted at the  <a href="#1.01.02-IT-as-function-2">outset</a>, IT has certain unchanging aspects regardless of whether is a separate or embedded organization. However, the purpose of this chapter is to help you think carefully about this very question.</p>

<p>Peter, the office manager, who is responsible for a range of operational, financial, and lightweight HR duties.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of your success, Lena needs to go from one team to two. She is cautious about this transition,  has heard that there are a few different ways in which this can be done, and the decisions may have long term consequences!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s assume you are going to break the product into two feature teams. One will focus on the existing market and the other will develop a new major feature for a new, distinct set of user value propositions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to do this, you are going to bring in a new UX specialist, a new Java programmer, a new sales person, and someone to field customer support calls. Lena also intends to step back a bit from direct product ownership, so a new Chief Marketing Officer comes in. She talks with an organizational consultant who proposed the following new structure:</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
What’s the difference between Sales and Marketing? Marketing tells a story that spreads. Sales overcomes the natural resistance to say yes.

<cite>http://www.ehow.com/info_8088140_cons-combining-marketing-sales.html</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may seem reasonable. Everyone agreed that there is no need to add more people to help Sonya and Andre; they can support both feature teams. Obviously, the new sales person comes in under Tomas.
Because Peter was the one receiving all the calls, and in the interest of giving him a clear career path, it was determined that the first product support person would come in under him, in what was anticipated to become a dedicated help desk/call center.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was perceived that the engineering team would likely be receiving various requests and so a dotted line appears on the organization chart, indicating a service relationship. The new support person under Peter would also be shared across both teams, and there needed to be some means of communicating support requests to the feature teams when their support was needed. There was some question as to how the office Kanban boards might be reconfigured to support these relationships. Peter and Sonya, after some online research, started to become interested in something called ITIL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But before that discussion continued, Lena retained another consultant as a cross-check. This consultant had worked with many Silicon Valley startups and had a very different opinion. This consultant was inspired by the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1018963/Articles/SpotifyScaling.pdf">“Spotify model”</a> and proposed the following scaled-down version of it:</p>

<p><strong>Sidebar: Dunbar and Spotify</strong>
Managing organizational growth is a well studied problem. Military examples are often seen, as military organizations have devoted much resource to understanding organizational dynamics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is much research into how human beings organize into groups of various sizes. Perhaps the best known is that of Robin Dunbar, who has theorized that human beings (as evolved primates) can “only comfortably maintain 150 stable relationships.” (per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dunbar has researched this projection across the anthropological data, finding that human groups tend to fall into size ranges of</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>30-50 (bands)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100-200 (clans)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>500-2500 (tribes)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Online music vendor Spotify has adopted insights from Dunbar as it scales.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Proposed structure #2</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consultant also added something called “guilds” to the model:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.07-with-guilds.png" alt="3.07 with guilds">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The “guilds” are not formal reporting mechanisms, but rather a way for people doing similar work to share experiences, best practices, and so forth. Each tribe has a designated lead:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tomas leads the Sales guild</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mohammed leads the UX guild</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aparna leads the Software Development guild</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sonya leads the Engineering guild</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TBD leads the support guild</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea would be that the guilds would meet regularly (perhaps bi-weekly) and would have their own forums on the company’s social media channels. The head of each guild would meet with Lena monthly to discuss issues and concerns, and would have a direct channel of communication to her as needed for more time sensitive matters.</p>

<p>One fact everyone agreed on was that Sonya had to do more Linux and Andre has to learn some NoSQL and other platform technology. But this fact was not put into the matrix as there was not agreement as to whether this was a pro or a con. On one hand, it did seem a bit wasteful, but it was also recognized as a good thing in terms of cross training and deepening the bench. Sonya also felt that a Data guild would eventually be needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everyone agreed that the engineering guild in particular would need to be a very strong guild, to ensure consistency of approaches around key disciplines like source control, security, platform choices, build pipeline, and so forth. The other guilds could be a bit lighter weight, but the engineering guild leader could set binding technical policies across the product teams if need be (the expectation was that this would not be done lightly).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was recognized that eventually a distinct operations &amp; engineering team might still be necessary, but probably not until another round of scaling, and that that team, per the Spotify model, would be more focused on setting up self-service tools for the product teams, and would avoid ticketed work as much as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another “neither pro nor con” but important was that the second option eliminated the new VP layer. Establishing an executive layer might still happen later, the consultant suggested, but it was premature to do so now.</p>

Five coordinating mechanisms seem to explain the fundamental ways in which organizations coordinate their work: mutual adjustment, direct supervision, standardization of work processes, standardization of work outputs, and standardization of worker skills.<br>
<br>
These should be considered the most basic elements of structure, the glue that holds or ganizations together…As organizational work becomes more complicated,  the favored means of coordination seems to shift from mutual adjustment to direct supervision to standardization, preferably of work processes, otherwise of outputs, or else of skills, <strong>finally reverting back to mutual adjustment</strong>.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned at the outset of this chapter, there is much research and thought available on the question of how to organize an enterprise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One useful model for understanding the problems of organizational structure is the Five Forces model of Henry Mintzberg  <a href="#Mintzberg1983">[Mintzberg1983]</a>. While much organization theory (even recent work) is presented as a simple, sequential model, the Mintzberg approach is more sophisticated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In simple, sequential models, organizations are presented as evolving from less good to more good types. Such models might propose a simplistic, bad-better-best sequence such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type 1 Simple, authoritarian and fear-based</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type 2 Strictly hierarchical and complex</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type 3 Divisionally decentralized</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type 4 Matrixed and process-driven</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type 5 Evolutionary/next-generation</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(The above sequence is a synthesis of various industry sources which are deliberately left unidentified, to protect the guilty.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, Mintzberg points out that different industry sectors and business types result in different kinds of organizational forms, and that certain tendencies (“pulls”) are evident which are not in and of themselves either good or bad.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Factors like line/staff interactions and lateral linkages also complicate the picture.
After extensive review and summarization of peer-reviewed research, Mintzberg developed the following models of corporate structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, the question of structure is at an equivalent level with various other internal concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Strategy</p>

<p>By this time, you probably detect that there is a fundamental tension between functional specialization and end to end value delivery.

<p>The above slide is worth a careful examination. The idea is that the more effective you are at product flow, the further to the right you are. The more efficient you are with your resources, the further up you are. It is easy to be completely efficient with resources, and have no flow. It is also possible to be very good at flow, but at the cost of little resource efficiency. Being excellent at both, however, is impossible - there is an outer boundary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, there is an interesting dynamic if you seek too much resource efficiency. Loading staff more and more heavily has counterproductive results, in which flow actually decreases, and the resulting "coordination chaos" also decreases resource efficiency in a vicious reinforcing feedback loop.</p>

<p>There is a spectrum of alternatives in structuring organizations for flow across functional concerns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, a lightweight product structure may be implemented, in which the project manager has limited power to influence the activity-based work, where people sit, etc. The project manager is little more than a factory floor expediter in this model.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The danger in using specialists lies in their low
involvement in individual projects and the multitude of tasks competing for their time." Work flows across the functions, perhaps called "centers of excellence," and there may be contention for resources within each center. Often, simple "first in, first out" approaches are used to manage the work, rather than more sophisticated approaches such as Cost of Delay. We will focus in Chapter 9 on approaches to mitigate these issues while retaining this overall organizational form.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, a heavyweight project structure may specify much more, including modes of work, standards, etc. The functional manager may be little more than a resource manager, but does still have reporting authority over the team member and crucially still writes their annual performance evaluation (if the organization still uses those.)</p>

<h4 id="_culture">Culture</h4>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
What is culture in this context? It is not so much about an informal dress code, flexible hours, or a free in-house cafeteria as it is about how decisions are taken, norms of behavior, protocols of communication, and the ways of navigating hierarchy and bureaucracy to get things done.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Culture" is a difficult term to define, and even more difficult to characterize across large organizations. It starts with how an organization is formally structured, as structure is in part a set of expectations around how information flows. "Who talks to who, when and why" is in a sense culture. Culture can also be seen embedded in artifacts like processes and formally specified operating models. Certainly, much in the previous section on organizational theory implied culture; Mintzberg&#8217;s Five Forces all come with their own cultural tendencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But "culture" has additional, less tangible meanings. The anecdotes executives choose to repeat are culture. Whether an organization tacitly condones being 5 minutes late for meetings (because walk time in large facilities is expected) or has little tolerance for this (because most people dial in) is culture. The degree of deference shown to senior executives, and their opinions, is culture. Whether a junior person dares to hit "reply-all" on an email including her boss&#8217;s boss is culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Culture cannot be directly changed - it is better seen as a lagging indicator, that changes in response to specific practical interventions. Even tools and processes can change culture, if they are judiciously chosen (and most tools and processes do <strong>not</strong> have this effect). Skeptical? Consider the impact that computers - a tool - have had on culture. Or email.</p>

<p>One of the most important reasons to be concerned for culture is its effect on motivation. There is little doubt that a more motivated team performs better than an unmotivated, "going through the motions" organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, it is an article of faith in the Agile and Lean communities that motivated teams are more likely to collaborate effectively and seek creative, novel solutions to problems. (I am not sure if there is  evidence to this effect, but it seems intuitively obvious.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what motivates people?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the oldest discussions of culture is Douglas McGregor&#8217;s idea of <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" class="bare">http://www.wikipedia.org/</a> ["Theory X" vs "Theory Y"] organizations, which he developed in the 1960s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Theory X" organizations rely on extrinsic motivators and operate on the assumption that workers must be cajoled and punished in order to produce results. We see Theory X approaches when organizations focus on pay scales, bonuses, titles, awards, writeups/demerits, performance appraisals, and the like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Theory Y organizations operate on the assumption that most people seek meaningful work intrinsically and that they have the ability to solve problems in creative ways that do not require tight standardization. According to Theory Y, people can be trusted and should be treated as mature individuals, in contrast to the distrust inherent in Theory X.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of intrinsic motivation, Daniel Pink, author of Drive, suggests that three concepts are key: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. If these three qualities are experienced by individuals and teams, they will be more likely to feel motivated and collaborate more effectively.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One model for understanding culture is the following matrix <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIbCcfxzc2A">proposed by Schneider</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.07-Schneider-matrix.png" alt="3.07 Schneider matrix">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two dimensions are proposed:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the extent to which the culture is focused on the company or the individual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the extent to which the company is "possibility-oriented" versus "reality-oriented"</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not a neutral matrix. It&#8217;s not clear that highly controlling cultures are ever truly effective. Even in the military, which is generally assumed to be the ultimate "command and control" culture, there are notable case studies of increased performance when more empowering approaches were encouraged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, in <em>Turn the Ship Around: A True Story of Turning Followers Into Leaders</em>, Captain L. David Marquette discusses moving from a command-driven to an outcome-driven model and the beneficial results it had on the <em>USS Santa Fe</em>. Similar themes appear in Captain D. Michael Abrashoff&#8217;s <em>It&#8217;s Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neither of these accounts is surprising, when one considers the more sophisticated aspects of military doctrine. Don Reinertsen provides a rigorous overview in chapter 9 of <em>Principles of Product Development Flow</em>. In this discussion, he notes that the military has been experimenting with centralized vs. decentralized control for centuries. Modern warfighting relies on autonomous, self-directed teams that may be out of touch with central command and required to improvise effectively to achieve the mission.  Therefore, military orders are incomplete without a statement of "commander&#8217;s intent" - the ultimate outcome of the mission. <a href="#Reinertsen2009">[Reinertsen2009]</a>, pp. 243-265.</p>

<blockquote>
Six years ago I began the research that led to [Toyota Kata] thinking, like just about everyone else, that the story was about techniques and other listable aspects of Toyota. Today I see Toyota in a notably different light: as an organization defined primarily by the unique behavior routines it continually teaches to all its members.

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Academics and consultants have been studying Toyota for many years. The performance and influence of the Japanese automaker is legendary, but it has been difficult to understand why.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Much has been written about Toyota&#8217;s use of particular tools, such as kanban bins and andon boards. However, Toyota views these as ephemeral adaptations to the demands of its business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to Mike Rother in <em>Toyota Kata</em>,  underlying Toyota&#8217;s particular tools and techniques are two powerful practices:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The improvement kata</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coaching kata</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is a <em>kata</em>? It is a Japanese word stemming from the martial arts, meaning pattern, routine, or drill. More deeply, it means "a way of keeping two things in alignment with each other."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The improvement kata is the repeated process by which Toyota managers investigate and resolve problems, in a hands-on, fact-based, and preconception-free manner, and improve processes towards a "target operating condition."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The coaching kata is how the improvement kata is instilled in new generations of Toyota managers.</p>

<img src="images/3.07-toyota-kata.png" alt="3.07 toyota kata">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Rother describes it, the coaching and improvement katas establish and reinforce a coherent culture or mental model of how goals are achieved and problems approached. It is understood that human judgement is not accurate or impartial. The method compensates with a teaching-by-example focus on seeking facts without preconceived notions, through direct, hands-on investigation and experimental approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not something that can be formalized into a simple checklist or process; it requires many guided examples and applications before the approach becomes ingrained in the upcoming manager.</p>

<p>We have previously discussed <a href="#2.04.02-features-v-components">feature vs component teams</a>.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an organization grows, we see both the feature and component sides scale. Feature teams start to diverge into multiple products, while component teams continue to grow in the guise of shared services and platforms. Their concerns continue to differentiate and communication friction may start to emerge between the teams. How an organization handles this is critical.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beware of simplistic progression models, which imply that organizational forms evolve from authoritarian to enlightened. You never get to done with organizational development and evolution. It is always an ongoing process, of balancing culture, centralization, and autonomy. Rather than seeking any "best practice," it is better to see a toolbox, or perhaps a set of levers you can position in various ways to get different results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As of 2015, product-centric Agile teams are becoming more and more common. But there are ultimately limitations to this approach, which many companies have experienced.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project management is traditionally defined as the execution of a given scope of work within constraints of time and budget. As we have seen in our discussions of product management, in implementing truly new IT-based products, estimating time and budget can be difficult because <strong>the necessary information is not available</strong>. In fact, creating it is the actual work of the "project". Therefore, in the new Agile world, there is some uncertainty as to the role and even need for traditional project management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, at a practical level, project managers remain important roles and are employed at both "unicorn" and "horse" companies as overall orchestrators of complex initiatives. Financial planning and resource management have not gone away and without project management, financial planning meets challenges, especially regarding the most ambitious efforts, the ones most critical to the business. The very concept of having a vision becomes problematic without some ability to plan.</p>

<p>Project management, like many other areas of IT practice, is undergoing considerable transformation in response to the Agile transition. However, it will likely remain an important tool for value delivery at various scales.

<h5 id="_what_is_a_project">What is a project?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the most fundamental aspects of a project. Essentially, a project can be seen as little more than a "to-do" list. However, rather than a miscellaneous list of errands, it is a to-do list that is aimed at delivering some overall end result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, comparing to your daily life, a random list of to-dos isn&#8217;t a project, but if you are organizing your annual holiday party, that certainly would qualify as a project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We could start with the following list:</p>
</div>
<table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all spread">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%;">
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Choose menu</p></td>

<tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the important characteristics of a project is that it is temporary. This project ends when we clean up after the party - not the most fun part.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project management however takes things much further. There are a number of ways that the list above can be refined using project management techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, we should probably organize the list a little better. And the task "clean house" - do we understand precisely what we mean by that? Maybe we should break this down into sub-tasks. There is also a question about "choose menu" - isn&#8217;t the menu part of the project plan? Also, you may notice that there are "dependencies." For example, we can&#8217;t send out invitations before we choose the date, nor can we fix the party food before we get groceries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s break out the heavyweight tools. Introducing Microsoft Project:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.08-ms-proj-1.png" alt="3.08 ms proj 1">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, let&#8217;s set up some sub-tasks and document the dependencies:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.08-ms-proj-2.png" alt="3.08 ms proj 2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice the bold headings:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean house before party</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Food for party</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and how they have indented "sub-tasks" underneath them. These are all the things that need to be completed, for the overall major task to be considered complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, we can&#8217;t call the house clean if the dining room isn&#8217;t vacuumed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also notice that, to the right, we see certain tasks are linked by thin black arrows. We are not going to decorate the house until all the cleaning is done, and we need to get the food prepared before we have the party. As mentioned above, these are called dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we look at the schedule, we see that the time is off. The party will be on December 19, so we need to adjust the dates. In addition, let&#8217;s indicate the initials of the person who is responsible for a given task.</p>

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cost of people&#8217;s time - forecast and actual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>% complete of a given task</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which sequence of tasks is the "critical path" - the sequence that must be done in order, that will take the longest time</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A project manager is responsible for all of this and more. A critical concept is that of "deliverable." In this example, the deliverable is the outcome of each task:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>invitations sent by 11/30 by CB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>menu decided by 12/17 by all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>house cleaned by 12/18 by all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>food prepared for guests by 12/18 by CB</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that deliverables are defined by "what," who <strong>and</strong> when.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While it is the responsibility of each contributor to the project to "meet" their deliverables, the project manager checks in regularly with each of them as to whether they will in fact be able to do this. In larger, more complex projects, the project manager updates the project plan with the effort expended to date, and the estimated time to completion. Individual status reports are assembled ("rolled up") into an overall picture of project status, reported to executives with a high level assessment of whether the project is likely to meet its objectives of cost, scope, quality, and schedule.</p>

<p>The project management <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">"Iron Triangle"</a> represents the interaction of cost, time, scope, and quality on a project. The idea is that, in general, one or more of these factors may be a constraint. The following sign is often seen in service organizations:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Turning to the problem of transactional friction:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This problem is distinct from the problem of feedback. It is also a bit more obvious on a tactical level. The most common response is project management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To understand how project management works across a functionally organized system, consider the internals of each functional area:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.08-mfg-w-resource.png" alt="3.08 mfg w resource">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each combination of worker and equipment can be considered a workstation in this simplified model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there is concern for flow across the functional areas, one technique used in manufacturing is that of expediting. The expeditor tracks the process across the work stations and ensures that any friction or blockages are overcome so that the entire process completes and value is delivered. This can be seen as a preliminary form of project management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the production line evolves, scheduling may be used as well: the assignment of work to each workstation (combination of worker and equipment) may have its timing and duration specified in advance. While this is not an optimal approach according to Lean philosophy (which emphasizes "pull" techniques), production scheduling is widely used in manufacturing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT systems development, when crossing functions, is rarely if ever considered as a simple end to end process that can run itself, with only a lightweight expeditor. Instead, since there is substantially increased complexity, a project paradigm is used across the functions. The project manager plays the role of expanded expeditor:</p>

<p>The above diagram, which you should study carefully, is a more detailed representation of the classic "waterfall" project. It still bears strong similarities to the idealized manufacturing model presented just previously. In particular, notice that the default model is that <strong>the need for the resource is tightly bounded by the calendar</strong>. In the above model, the following resource requirements are apparent:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>One Requirements analyst is needed between times A and B (e.g, from May 1 through 15).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One Architect is needed between times B and C (e.g., from May 16 through 31)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One Developer is needed between times C and D (e.g., from June 1 through 15)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One Release Engineer is needed between times D and E (e.g., from June 15 through 30)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>This is a deliberately unworkable model for illustration.</strong> (But the author can attest it has been tried&#8230;&#8203;) Sometimes, the terms "mechanistic," "deterministic," or "linear" are used to describe waterfall project methods. This shows them at their extreme, insofar as they are essentially translations of a manufacturing model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic problem: if the Developer is released from the project on June 15, and issues were to arise on June 20 with the release, flow would be interrupted and the system would not be delivered successfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of this, the project may retain some residual claim on all the engaged resources, but their utilization may be low or zero at certain points. Pivoting the above diagram 90 degrees, we start to develop an understanding of the interrelatedness of product development:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>No matter what your organization structure, you need process. Toyota considers a clear process vision, or "target condition," to be the most fundamental objective in improving operations. Process, in terms of "business process," has been a topic of study and professional education for many years. Designing processes, improving them, and using them to improve overall  performance is an ongoing activity in most if not all organizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, some less than effective things have been done in the name of "process." Both ITIL and the Capability Maturity Model-Integrated claim to be "process"-oriented, but their results have been questioned. In particular, there is risk in allowing processes to proliferate - the organization can only tolerate a certain number of processes before people start to become confused and demoralized by all the "bureaucracy." Organzational improvement approaches that encourage the formation of processes and associated metrics at all levels may therefore not be an effective model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, process remains an important tool in the toolkit for organization design.</p>

<blockquote>
One organization enthusiastically embraced process improvement, with good reason: customers, suppliers, and employees found the company&#8217;s processes slow, inconsistent, and error prone. Unfortunately, they were so enthusiastic that each team defined the work of their small group or department as a complete process. Of course, each of these was in fact the contribution of a specialized functional group to some larger, but unidentified, processes. Each of these "processes" was "improved" independently, and you can guess what happened.<br>
<br>
 Within the boundaries of each process, improvements were implemented that made work more efficient from the perspective of the performer. However, these mini-processes were efficient largely because they had front-end constraints that made work easier for the performer but imposed a burden on the customer or the preceding process. The attendant delay and effort meant that the true business processes behaved even more poorly than they had before. This is a common outcome when processes are defined too "small." Moral: Don&#8217;t confuse subprocesses or activities with business processes.

<p>You are now running one of the larger and more complex IT-based operations on the planet, with an annual IT budget of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. You have thousands of programmers, systems engineers, and IT managers, with a wide variety of responsibilities.  IT is in your market-facing products and in your back-office operations. In fact, it&#8217;s sometimes hard to distinguish the boundaries as your company transforms into a digital business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile techniques remain important to you, but things are getting complex and you&#8217;re testing the boundaries of what is possible. How can you operate at the scale you&#8217;ve achieved and still be Agile? As usual in life, you&#8217;re finding that there are always tradeoffs. Decisions you made long ago come back to haunt you, security threats are increasing, and at your scale there&#8217;s no escaping the auditors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But you have great resources at your command, and you&#8217;re as well positioned as any of your competitors to meet the challenges ahead. And in the end, that&#8217;s all you need.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Architecture and governance are two topics that become more important as a company scales up and ages. Decisions that might have been made quickly and casually by a product or project team become more difficult, due to increasingly challenging structural factors both internal and external. Decisions made years ago come back to haunt current strategies with a vengeance. With scale, management needs higher level technical abstractions in order to manage. Architecture provides these, but doing so is difficult and controversial. What happens when management decides to set direction using these same abstractions, and architects find themselves now enforcing what had originally started as mere sense-making?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vendor relationships become a two-edged sword, providing increased value with access to higher levels of vendor resources, but at the cost of increased lock-in. Pure open-source strategies inevitably become corrupted by business realities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Security threats increase proportionally to the company&#8217;s size. The talent and persistence of these adversaries is remarkable. Another set of antagonists are, on paper, "on the same side," but auditors are never to be taken for granted. Why are they investigating IT systems? What are their motivations and responsibilities? Finally, what laws and regulations are relevant to IT? Data protection, retention, ?</p>

<p><strong>Use of the word "architecture" in information technology</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Architecture" is of course a word usually associated with physical construction: buildings, landscapes, etc. It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture">appropriated by systems engineers at IBM in 1959</a> to describe the problems of designing complex information processing hardware and software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This leads to some confusion, and occasional questions from "real" architects as to why IT people are calling themselves "architects." Perhaps a different choice of word would have been advisable.</p>

<p>Portfolio management in terms of information technology means looking at long-lived IT investments in terms of their overall cost, risk, and benefit to the corporation. This can and should be done regardless of whether the IT investment is external or internal facing. Products, services, and applications are the most useful portrfolio constructs, although assets, technology products, and even projects also can figure into longer-horizon value management. Enterprise architecture benefits from a tight alignment with IT portfolio management, as well.</p>

<p>Analytics and metrics are a related topic for IT management. There are many ways that metrics can be used and misused.

<p><em>Chapter 11 content to be moved to new file</em>
Over time, the IT operation develops significant data by which to manage itself. It may develop one or more definitive portfolio list, typically applications, services, assets, and/or technology products. Distinguishing and baselining high quality versions of these data sets can consume inordinate resource, and yet managing the IT organization at scale is nearly impossible without them..
