==== IT Governance


===== What is governance?
[quote, ISO 38500:2008, adapted from Cadbury/OECD 1999]
The system by which organizations are directed and controlled.

IT Governance is a challenging and often misunderstood concept. First and foremost, it must be distinguished from "management." This is not always easy, but remains essential.

Here is simple explanation:

Suppose you own a small retail store. For years, you were the primary operator. You might have hired an occasional cashier, but that person had limited authority; they had the keys to the store and cash register, but not the safe combination, nor was their name on the bank account. They did not talk to your suppliers. They received an hourly wage and you gave them direct and ongoing supervision.

In this case, you were a manager. Governance was not part of the relationship.

Now, you wish to go on an extended vacation. You need someone who can count the cash and deposit it, and place orders with and pay your suppliers. You need to hire a professional manager.

They will likely draw a salary, perhaps some percentage of your proceeds, and you will not supervise them in detail as you did the cashier. Instead, you will set overall guidance and expectations for the results they produce. How do you do this? And perhaps even more importantly, how do you trust this person?

*Now, you need governance.*

The temptation is to lump all of "management" in with governance. The VP of sales, or HR, "governs" their function, for example. While sometimes tempting to executives who want to elevate their status, this is not the intent of the term.

Even the quote at the top of this chapter might be falling into this problem. Is the problem "governance" per se, or is it the management response to governance requirements? Governance policies set at the board level might result in a variety of operational processes, but are those processes "governance" processes?

Some of this may be specific to the organization, but in general it is advisable to limit the "governance" domain to a narrow scope of board or director-level concerns, and the existence of certain capabilities such as external and internal audit and controls.

Governance is about managing results and risk. It's about objectives and outcomes. It's about "what," not "how."

====== IT Governance definitions
If "corporate governance" (per ISO 38500, based on other standards) is "The system by which organizations are directed and controlled," then it is reasonable that "corporate governance of IT" is "The system by which the current and future use of IT is directed and controlled." <<ISO2008>>.

===== Internal controls
[quote, Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, Internal Control - Integrated Framework]
Internal control is a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations, reporting, and compliance.

Have existed from ancient times

"Working to rule" - when they proliferate
controls theater
this is called the "control environment"

****
Control activities are the actions established through policies and procedures that help ensure that management's directives to mitigate risks to the achievement of objectives are carried out. Control activities are performed at all levels of the entity, at various stages within business processes, and over the technology environment. They may be preventive or detective in nature and may encompass a range of manual and automated activities such as authorizations and approvals, verifications, reconciliations, and business performance reviews.

Ongoing evaluations, separate evaluations, or some combination of the two are used to ascertain whether each of the five components of internal control, including controls to effect the principles within each component, is present and functioning. Ongoing evaluations, built into business processes at different levels of the entity, provide timely information. Separate evaluations, conducted periodically, will vary in scope and frequency depending on assessment of risks, effectiveness of ongoing evaluations, and other management considerations. Findings are evaluated against criteria established by regulators, recognized standard-setting bodies or management and the board of directors, and deficiencies are communicated to management and the board of directors as appropriate.

===== IT Audit
[quote, Scott Ambler, Disciplined Agile Delivery]
Agile or not, a team ultimately has to meet legal and essential organizational needs, and audits help to ensure this.

====== External audit

"The Committee therefore recommends that all listed companies should establish an audit committee."  <<Cadbury1992>>, 4.35


====== Internal audit

Phoenix project example

"The function of the internal auditors is complementary to, but different from, that of the outside auditors." <<Cadbury1992>>, 4.39

====== Governance demand

importance of having the demand/execution framework in place to manage governance demand

===== Governance and sourcing
We have already covered contracting in terms of software and Cloud. But in terms of the emergence model, it is typical that companies enter into contracts before having a fully mature sourcing and contract management capability with input from the governance, risk, and compliance perspective.

===== Agile meets IT governance

"The wall" is embedded in ISO 38500... product-centric management is not supported

Are governance frameworks suited to define execution models?
