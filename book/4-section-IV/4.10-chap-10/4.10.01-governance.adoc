==== IT Governance


===== What is governance?
[quote, ISO 38500:2008, adapted from Cadbury/OECD 1999]
The system by which organizations are directed and controlled.

To talk about IT governance, we must talk about governance in general.

Governance is a challenging and often misunderstood concept. First and foremost, it must be distinguished from "management." This is not always easy, but remains essential.

Here is simple explanation:

_Credit: I got this from hearing Brian Barnier speak at an ISACA meeting around 2011._

Suppose you own a small retail store. For years, you were the primary operator. You might have hired an occasional cashier, but that person had limited authority; they had the keys to the store and cash register, but not the safe combination, nor was their name on the bank account. They did not talk to your suppliers. They received an hourly wage and you gave them direct and ongoing supervision.

In this case, you were a manager. Governance was not part of the relationship.

Now, you wish to go on an extended vacation. You need someone who can count the cash and deposit it, and place orders with and pay your suppliers. You need to hire a professional manager.

They will likely draw a salary, perhaps some percentage of your proceeds, and you will not supervise them in detail as you did the cashier. Instead, you will set overall guidance and expectations for the results they produce. How do you do this? And perhaps even more importantly, how do you trust this person?

*Now, you need governance.*

In political science and economics,

====== Governance vis-a-vis management

The temptation is to lump all of "management" in with governance. The VP of sales, or HR, "governs" their function, for example. While sometimes tempting to executives who want to elevate their status, this is not the intent of the term.

We often hear of "bureaucratic" governance processes, as well. But is the problem "governance" per se, or is it the management response to governance requirements? Governance policies set at the board level might result in a variety of operational processes, but are those processes "governance" processes? Or management processes?

Of course, if the board is micro-managing, demanding many different kinds of information, then governance and its management response is all much the same thing. In reality, however, burdensome organizational "governance" processes may be an overdone response to *perceived* Board-level mandates. Or point-in-time requirements no longer needed.

Some of this may be specific to the organization, but in general it is advisable to limit the "governance" domain -- including use of the term -- to a narrow scope of board or director-level concerns, and the existence of certain capabilities, including:

* organizational policy management
* external and internal audit
* risk management
* controls management (perhaps part of risk)

Governance is about managing results and risk. It's about objectives and outcomes. It's about "what," not "how."

Corporate governance is a broad and deep topic, essential to the functioning of society and its organized participants. These include for-profit, non-profit, and even governmental organizations. Any legally organized entity of significant scope has governance needs. If you are taking any courses on Finance or Accounting, you will likely cover governance objectives and processes.

*Systems theory, feedback, control, and governance*
We've encountered systems theory and associated concepts such as xref:2.00.01-feedback[feedback] and xref:empirical-process-control[control] throughout this book. The idea of "governance" predates these, but in an interesting way.

The term "governance" originates from the Greek word κυβερνάω [kubernáo], which means "to steer," as in a ship. Nautical navigation is a process of feedback and correction. The same Greek word is also the basis for the term "cybernetics," another word closely associated with systems and control theory.

_Centrifugal governor, public domain image via Wikipedia_

"Governors" have been part of mechanical systems for centuries. These mechanisms have the effect of automatically controlling a system so that it (for example) operates at the desired revolutions per minute. Without governors, steam engines tended to blow up, or go out; applying devices such as the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_governor[centrifugal governor] to regulate them was an important step in the development of steam power. Importantly, such devices operated to control the process from variation on either side, whether too fast or too slow. They did not operate merely as brakes.

So, if you find yourself coping with arbitrary and bureaucratic "governance" processes, it might be good to remember the origins of the term. Governance that only slows a system down, only adds resistance, is not truly governance.

====== IT Governance definitions
If "corporate governance" (per ISO 38500, based on other standards) is "The system by which organizations are directed and controlled," then it is reasonable that "corporate governance of IT" is "The system by which the current and future use of IT is directed and controlled." <<ISO2008>>.

===== Internal controls
[quote, Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, Internal Control - Integrated Framework]
Internal control is a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations, reporting, and compliance.

Have existed from ancient times

"Working to rule" - when they proliferate
controls theater
this is called the "control environment"

Because it is so essential, official statements defining control carry much influence. The leading definition of internal control and its related practices is published by the Council of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

*What is COSO?*

The Council of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) has a non-intuitive name, especially given its global influence.

COSO is a "private sector initiative," funded by:

* Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA),
* American Accounting Association (AAA),
* Financial Executives International (FEI),
* Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA)
* Institute of Management Accountants (IMA).

It was founded in 1985 to support the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting, and has published various reports and guidance mostly concerned with the topic of internal control.

Control activities are the actions established through policies and procedures that help ensure that management's directives to mitigate risks to the achievement of objectives are carried out. Control activities are performed at all levels of the entity, at various stages within business processes, and over the technology environment. They may be preventive or detective in nature and may encompass a range of manual and automated activities such as authorizations and approvals, verifications, reconciliations, and business performance reviews.

Ongoing evaluations, separate evaluations, or some combination of the two are used to ascertain whether each of the five components of internal control, including controls to effect the principles within each component, is present and functioning. Ongoing evaluations, built into business processes at different levels of the entity, provide timely information. Separate evaluations, conducted periodically, will vary in scope and frequency depending on assessment of risks, effectiveness of ongoing evaluations, and other management considerations. Findings are evaluated against criteria established by regulators, recognized standard-setting bodies or management and the board of directors, and deficiencies are communicated to management and the board of directors as appropriate.

===== IT Audit
[quote, Scott Ambler, Disciplined Agile Delivery]
Agile or not, a team ultimately has to meet legal and essential organizational needs, and audits help to ensure this.

====== External audit

"The Committee therefore recommends that all listed companies should establish an audit committee."  <<Cadbury1992>>, 4.35


====== Internal audit

Phoenix project example

"The function of the internal auditors is complementary to, but different from, that of the outside auditors." <<Cadbury1992>>, 4.39

===== Governance and sourcing
We have already covered contracting in terms of software and Cloud. But in terms of the emergence model, it is typical that companies enter into contracts before having a fully mature sourcing and contract management capability with input from the governance, risk, and compliance perspective.
